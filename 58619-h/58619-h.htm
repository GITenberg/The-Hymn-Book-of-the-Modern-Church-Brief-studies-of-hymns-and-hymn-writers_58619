<h2 title=""><span class="h2line1">PREFACE</span></h2>
<p>This lecture consists of a series of essays introductory
to the study of English hymns, in
which I have tried to give some account of
the sources from which the Church gathers its sacred
songs, and to sketch briefly the growth of the modern
hymn-book. It has been necessary to omit several
sections which I had intended to include, and this
volume covers a portion only of the ground indicated
by the title. I may, perhaps, some day be able to
carry the work a stage nearer completeness.</p>
<p>It may be thought that I have given disproportionate
space to certain periods and to certain hymn-writers.
If so, I can only say that they seemed to me specially
interesting or important. In quotations, especially
from less-known writers, I have taken as much liberty
as possible, and I think this is the redeeming feature
of the lecture. In extended quotations I have usually
given the preference to hymns not readily accessible
to the general reader, and have only occasionally quoted
hymns to be found in the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i>.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_viii">viii</div>
<p>To the hymns of the Wesleys I have given considerable
space. The subject was chosen for me in view
of the publication of the new Methodist Hymn-book,
and the occasion seemed to require a somewhat detailed
survey of the early Methodist hymns. Nor do I think
that many will consider the attention given to them
more than their intrinsic value justifies. &lsquo;After the
Scriptures,&rsquo; wrote Dr. James Martineau, &lsquo;the Wesley
Hymn-book appears to me the grandest instrument of
popular religious culture that Christendom has ever
produced.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Delightful as this work has been to me, the book
has been written under great pressure and amid
countless interruptions. I have had to redeem odd
minutes and the evening hours when a long day&rsquo;s
work had already been done.</p>
<p>I have to acknowledge constant obligation&mdash;much
more extensive than is indicated by frequent reference&mdash;to
Dr. Julian&rsquo;s monumental <i>Dictionary of Hymnology</i>,
which has lightened the labour of research for all
students of hymns.</p>
<p>To my friend, Dr. J. T. L. Maggs, I am under
manifold obligations which I most gratefully record.
Dr. Maggs read a great part of the book in MS, and
the whole in proof; and I am also indebted to him for
calling my attention to, or procuring for me, some
important books of reference. Mr. W. Garrett Horder
has also given me the benefit of his advice and
<span class="pb" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
criticism&mdash;all the more valuable because his judgement
has often differed from my own.</p>
<p>It is a pleasure to mention the valuable help rendered
me by some of my friends connected with The Children&rsquo;s
Home, and especially by Miss F. L. Moon (now Mrs.
Carey), who most kindly relieved me of the greater part
of the burden of the actual preparation of the MS.
for the press. My son, Benjamin A. Gregory, has
prepared the Index, verified quotations, and helped me
in many other ways.</p>
<p>No Fernley Lecturer has had a more attractive
theme. I wish its treatment had been more worthy.
But with all its imperfections I trust that He who
inhabiteth the praises of Israel may deign to bless
my little book to the edification and comfort of some
who read it.</p>

<h1 title="">THE HYMN-BOOK OF THE MODERN CHURCH</h1>
<h2 id="ch1"><span class="h2line1">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>The source and inspiration of Christian song is
the word of Christ. &lsquo;Let the word of Christ
dwell in you richly in all wisdom.&rsquo; The
common phrases of common life cannot satisfy the soul
filled with the Spirit and rich with the wealth of
Christ&rsquo;s indwelling word. Religious emotion finds
truer and more fitting expression in poetry than in
prose. If God had not given to His Church poets, as
well as apostles, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, the
best that is in us could never have been uttered.
Words and phrases that are large enough for intercourse
with our fellows become cramped and inexpressive
when we speak to God. Praise and penitence
alike would often be silent in the congregation of the
saints if they could not at once veil and reveal their
profoundest feelings in psalms and hymns. Poetry
gives to devotion those robes of glory and beauty
without which it would, at times, be almost unseemly
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
to join in the public worship of God or to disclose the
heart&rsquo;s secrets in the presence of fellow-worshippers.</p>
<p>Our theme, then, is peculiarly sacred, since it deals
with the spiritual songs in which earnest and sincere
men have uttered, in the very presence of God, their
most secret thoughts, confessions, and aspirations.
Every true hymn was first spoken by one man to God
alone, was prayed before it was sung, though now it
may be heard daily from ten thousand voices. Harsh
or flippant criticism is out of place here, an irreverent
impertinence, like the interruption of private prayer.
In the study of hymns</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Put off thy shoes from off thy feet;</p>
<p class="t0">The place where man his God shall meet</p>
<p class="t">Be sure is holy ground.<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Yet St. Paul himself reminds us that the word of
Christ is to dwell wisely as well as richly in our hearts.
&lsquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all
wisdom.&rsquo; &lsquo;Next to a sound rule of faith, there is
nothing of so much consequence as a sober standard
of feeling in matters of religion.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a> Morbid, insincere,
fanatical, or exaggerated emotion is as much to be
deprecated as doctrinal error, and its evils are at least
as disastrous. The diffusion of false or superficial
sentiment in the household of the faith is like the
spreading of a subtle disease which saps the strength
and mars the beauty of devotion, while error bears a
charmed life if it comes in the words of a familiar
<span class="pb" id="Page_3">3</span>
and attractive hymn. Moreover, it is in the hymns
of the Church rather than in its formal declarations
of faith and doctrine that we find the truest
and generally the most favourable revelation of its
character. Hymnology is a more important element in
the history of religion than most Church historians and
theological writers have recognized.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a></p>
<p>The present time is in many respects peculiarly
appropriate for a consideration of the growth and
development of the hymns of the modern Church. We
are in a state of rest or pause after tumult. The great
religious &lsquo;movements&rsquo; of the eighteenth and nineteenth
centuries are matters of history, and we can regard even
the most recent of them calmly and without the prejudice
which while conflict rages may, not altogether
unfairly, be regarded as patriotism. The Methodist
Revival, the Evangelical Awakening, the Oxford Movement,
the Salvation Army Campaign, the Undenominational
Evangelism of Messrs. Moody and Sankey, may
all be taken into account in considering the material
and character of the hymn-book of the modern Church.</p>
<p>Again, it is interesting to remember that of the
hymn-writers of the nineteenth century few survive.
For the moment there is neither evangelist nor poet to
give us new songs. Our fathers made hymn-books; we
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
re-edit them. Within the last few years the standard
Presbyterian, Baptist, Anglican,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> and Methodist hymn-books
have appeared in new and revised editions,
whilst in the <i>Arundel Hymns</i> we have the most recent
Roman Catholic hymnal. Dr. Barrett&rsquo;s <i>Congregational
Church Hymnal</i>, issued in 1887, is of the modern
type, though it preserves many of the features of the
older Nonconformist books. Mr. Garrett Horder&rsquo;s
<i>Worship-Song</i> represents the taste of an individual, not
of a committee or community; but it is in many
respects the best and most complete collection of the
hymns of the modern Church. These books enable
us to discover current opinion and taste in regard to
hymns which are worthy to take their place in the
service of the Christian sanctuary, and both in their
unity and diversity are of great value as indicating the
life and thought of the Churches they represent.</p>
<p>In this lecture I shall attempt&mdash;</p>
<p>1. A brief preliminary inquiry into what constitutes
a true hymn, suited for use in Christian worship.</p>
<p>2. A very brief review of the relation of the Hebrew
Psalter to the Christian Hymnal, and a passing glance
at the hymns of the New Testament and of the early
Church.</p>
<p>3. A more detailed survey of the rise and development
of modern English hymns and their use in the
Church since the Reformation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Such a study, however unskilfully guided, cannot,
I hope, be altogether without interest or edification, since
it brings the student into fellowship with the sweetest
and the saintliest souls, and bids him join in spirit the
choir invisible who praise God day and night in His
temple.</p>
<p class="tb">I regret that the limits assigned to my lecture
make it impossible to refer to translations from the
Greek, Latin, German, and other languages. These
form a most valuable and an increasing portion of all
modern hymnals. They furnish abundant material for
a separate volume.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<h2 id="ch2"><span class="h2line1">I</span>
<br />A True Hymn</h2>
<p>When my revered father, more than thirty
years ago, delivered the fourth Fernley
Lecture, he laid this down as the first
scriptural Church principle&mdash;&lsquo;The Church is not a
thing of rigid definition.&rsquo; I may adapt that phrase to
my own subject, and say, <i>A hymn is not a thing of
rigid definition</i>.</p>
<p>Commenting on the note which closes the second
book of Psalms, &lsquo;The prayers [LXX. <i>hymns</i>] of David
the son of Jesse are ended,&rsquo; St. Augustine gives this
definition:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hymns are praises of God with singing, hymns are
songs containing praises of God. If there be praise, and not
praise of God, it is not a hymn. If there be praise, and praise
of God, and it is not sung, it is not a hymn. It is necessary,
therefore, if it be a hymn, that it have these three things:
both praise, and praise of God, and that it be sung.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In commenting on Ps. cxlviii. he repeats this rule
in almost the same words. The definition commends
itself at once as excellent, and in regard to a large
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
number of hymns adequate; but even when the widest
sense is given to the words it is much too narrow and
would exclude many of the truest hymns. Indeed, it is
impossible to deny the title to innumerable compositions
which do not fulfil these conditions. Many a
verse of which it may be said, This is not a hymn,
demonstrates its right by the fact that it is hymned by
the Church from age to age.</p>
<p>St. Augustine&rsquo;s third canon may be accepted without
hesitation. A poem that cannot be sung may
speak in the sublimest accents of devotion, yet it is of
necessity unsuited to the service of the Christian choir.
Spenser&rsquo;s &lsquo;Hymn of Heavenly Love&rsquo; is a glorious example
of this form of praise. Indeed, there are some
stanzas which a skilful hand might make available for
use in the congregation.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O bless&egrave;d Well of Love, O Flower of Grace,</p>
<p class="t0">O glorious Morning Star, O Lamp of Light!</p>
<p class="t0">Most lively image of Thy Father&rsquo;s face,</p>
<p class="t0">Eternal King of Glory, Lord of Might,</p>
<p class="t0">Meek Lamb of God, before all worlds behight,<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></p>
<p class="t0">How can we Thee requite for all this good?</p>
<p class="t0">Or what can prize that Thy most precious blood?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yet nought Thou ask&rsquo;st in lieu of all this love,</p>
<p class="t0">But love of us for guerdon of Thy pain:</p>
<p class="t0">Ay me! What can us less than that behove?</p>
<p class="t0">Had He requir&egrave;d life of us again,</p>
<p class="t0">Had it been wrong to ask His own with gain?</p>
<p class="t0">He gave us life, He it restor&egrave;d lost;</p>
<p class="t0">Then life were least, that us so little cost.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_8">8</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But He our life hath left unto us free,</p>
<p class="t0">Free that was thrall, and bless&egrave;d that was banned;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor ought demands but that we loving be,</p>
<p class="t0">As He Himself hath loved us afore-hand;</p>
<p class="t0">And bound thereto with an eternal band,</p>
<p class="t0">Him first to love that us so dearly bought,</p>
<p class="t0">And next our brethren to His image wrought.</p>
</div>
<p>Many of Herbert&rsquo;s and of Miss Rossetti&rsquo;s poems
are of the same type. We would give much to add
them to our hymnals, but they would be out of place
there. They belong to the manual of devotion.</p>
<p>That the primary idea of a hymn is praise may
also be granted, but even so &lsquo;praise&rsquo; must be given
an extensive connotation, that it may include whatever
directly or indirectly glorifies God. St. Paul&rsquo;s exhortations
show how much more than the offering of adoration
is included in the province of Christian song. Our
hymn-book, like the Hebrew Psalter, must have not
only its songs of high thanksgiving, its sacrifice of praise,
but also its prayer of the penitent as he poureth out
his soul unto God, its sin-offering as well as its
thank-offering, its intercessions and meditations, its
instructions and exhortations, its lighter songs and
melodies. &lsquo;Every feeling which enters into any
act of true worship may fitly find expression in a
hymn.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Dr. Johnson declared that sacred poetry must
always be poor because &lsquo;the topics of devotion are
few, and being few are universally known; but few
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
as they are can be made no more.&rsquo; To this criticism
Keble replied in his essay on Sacred Poetry&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How can the topics of devotion be few, when we are
taught to make every part of life, every scene in nature,
an occasion&mdash;in other words, a topic&mdash;of devotion? It
might as well be said that connubial love is an unfit subject
for poetry, as being incapable of novelty, because, after all,
it is only ringing the changes upon one simple affection,
which every one understands. The novelty there consists,
not in the original topic, but in continually bringing ordinary
things, by happy strokes of natural ingenuity, into
new associations with the ruling passion.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s not a bonnie flower that springs</p>
<p class="t">By fountain, shaw, or green;</p>
<p class="t0">There&rsquo;s not a bonnie bird that sings</p>
<p class="t">But minds me of my Jean.</p>
</div>
<p>Why need we fear to extend this most beautiful and natural
sentiment to &lsquo;the intercourse between the human soul and
its Maker&rsquo;?<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If, on its subjective side, sacred poetry has a wide
range of topics, how manifold and how magnificent
are the themes presented by the historic facts upon
which faith rests, and by the great truths of the
gospel! In Johnson&rsquo;s day no one understood how
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
large a realm belonged to the Christian singer, but we
have no cause to complain of sameness or dullness in
the songs of the Christian choir.</p>
<p>St. Augustine&rsquo;s second canon need not be regarded
as implying that every hymn must be formally addressed
to God. The very hymns (the psalms) upon
which he was commenting abundantly justify our use
of hymns which are rather uttered in the divine
presence than actually spoken to God. The 103rd
Psalm is as truly a hymn of praise, and that of God,
as the 104th. After the same self-exhortation, &lsquo;Bless
the Lord, O my soul,&rsquo; the one continues in the form
of a devout meditation, in which the consciousness
that God hears is never for a moment absent; while
the other at once addresses &lsquo;the Majesty on high.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Lord my God, Thou art very great;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou art clothed with honour and majesty.</p>
</div>
<p>Both might have ended with</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let my meditation<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> be sweet unto Him;</p>
<p class="lr">civ. 34.</p>
</div>
<p>or, in the words of another psalm&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation<a class="fn" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> of my heart, be acceptable in Thy sight,</p>
<p class="t0">O Lord, my Strength, and my Redeemer.</p>
<p class="lr">xix. 14.</p>
</div>
<p>Devout meditations which do not actually speak
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
to God are amongst the best and most truly devotional
hymns. Watts&rsquo;s spiritual song,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There is a land of pure delight,</p>
</div>
<p>is an example of the hymn which is only indirectly a
prayer; whilst</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When I survey the wondrous Cross</p>
</div>
<p>illustrates the meditation which is partly the communing
of the soul with itself, and partly (perhaps in
this case only in the second verse) a direct address to
God. Yet each is a true hymn. The ideal exercise
of the Christian hymn-writer is the practice of the
presence of God.</p>
<p>Not only, then, are the subjects of sacred song
infinitely varied, but the forms it may assume are
many. In the poet, as well as in the prophet, God
speaks &lsquo;in divers manners.&rsquo; This is seen in St. Paul&rsquo;s
twice repeated classification, &lsquo;psalms, hymns, spiritual
songs,&rsquo; and by the directions he gives for the use of
song in the Church.</p>
<p>In the Epistle to the Ephesians he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>And be not drunken with wine, wherein is riot, but be
filled with the Spirit; speaking one to another in psalms
and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody
with your heart to the Lord; giving thanks always for all
things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God, even
the Father.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the Epistle to the Colossians:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all
wisdom; teaching and admonishing one another with
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace
in your hearts unto God. And whatsoever ye do, in word
or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving
thanks to God the Father through Him.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Psalms</i> are, no doubt, primarily, if not exclusively,
those of the Old Testament, which would naturally
form the basis of the hymn-book of the Christian
Church. It would have been the worst ingratitude,
the most crass stupidity, if such a treasure actually
in their hands and in their hearts had not been
adopted in the services of the first Christian worshippers,
even though it must soon have been felt
that some psalms were as little in harmony with the
spirit of the new dispensation as the law which Christ
Himself enlarged and enlightened.</p>
<p><i>Hymns</i> &lsquo;would more appropriately designate those
hymns of praise which were composed by the Christians
themselves.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a>
Of these, as we shall note in the next chapter, some fragments remain,
and they are specially characteristic of Christian worship.
&lsquo;It was of the essence of the Greek
<span title="hymnos" class="g">&#8021;&mu;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
(hymn) that it should be ... addressed to a god or hero, that is, a deified
man.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>
Christianity inherited the Hebrew psalm, it adopted
and consecrated the Greek hymn.</p>
<p><i>Ode</i>, or song, is a more general term, qualified and
limited by the epithet &lsquo;spiritual,&rsquo; and may be regarded
as justifying our use of many modern hymns which
a severe or narrow taste would reject. Bishop Beveridge
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
understood it to include &lsquo;all sorts of songs upon any
spiritual subject.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Probably the three terms were not very rigidly
distinguished, though they are convenient for describing
various classes of devotional poetry. In the title of
Ps. lxxv. the LXX. gives the three words: &lsquo;among
hymns, a psalm for Asaph, an ode concerning the
Assyrian.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The variety of form which the songs of the Christian
temple may assume is seen to be of the utmost value
when we consider how large a part the ministry of
song has in Christian life and worship. Although
Jehovah is &lsquo;exalted above all blessing and praise,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a> yet
does He sit &lsquo;enthroned upon the praises of Israel.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
&lsquo;Praise waiteth for God in Zion.&rsquo; The ancient summons
to worship is&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Enter into His gates with thanksgiving,</p>
<p class="t0">And into His courts with praise.</p>
<p class="lr">c. 4.</p>
</div>
<p>The walls of the city of God are called Salvation, and
her gates Praise.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> The mystic Jerusalem is the true
&lsquo;city of praise.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a> The one offering of the Christian
temple is its perpetual eucharist,<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a>
&lsquo;the sacrifice of praise.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>
The high praises of God are in the mouth
of His saints because His love is shed abroad in their
hearts, and they &lsquo;cannot from His praise forbear.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jerusalem makes melody</p>
<p class="t">For simple joy of heart,</p>
<p class="t0">An organ of full compass she,</p>
<p class="t">One tuned through every part;</p>
<p class="t0">While not to day or night belong</p>
<p class="t0">Her matins and her evensong,</p>
<p class="t0">The one thanksgiving of her song.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Whatever the form of the song, its music is for the ear
of God, its melody is that of the heart.</p>
<p>In the Christian Church, as in the Jewish Temple,
we may call instrumental music to our aid, and count
its offering not unacceptable to God.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet:</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him with the psaltery and harp.</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him with the timbrel and dance:</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him with stringed instruments and the pipe.</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him upon the loud cymbals:</p>
<p class="t0">Praise Him upon the high-sounding cymbals.</p>
</div>
<p>Yet all this pomp and circumstance of worship are but
sounding brass and clanging cymbal unless there be
the accompaniment of &lsquo;grace in the heart.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise Him every tuneful string;</p>
<p class="t">All the reach of heavenly art,</p>
<p class="t0">All the powers of music bring,</p>
<p class="t">The music of the heart.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Praise needs &lsquo;a thousand tongues,&rsquo; and even so
would find &lsquo;eternity too short&rsquo; for its service.</p>
<p class="tb">Though St. Paul associates praise&mdash;thanksgiving&mdash;with
singing in both the passages referred to, it is
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
instructive to note how clearly he asserts the teaching
function of the songs of the Church: &lsquo;Speaking one to
another,&rsquo; &lsquo;teaching and admonishing one another.&rsquo;
Bishop Christopher Wordsworth said, as I think,
truly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Christian poetry ought to be a medium for the conveyance
of Christian doctrine.... A Church which
forgoes the use of hymns in her office of teaching
neglects one of the most efficacious instruments for correcting
error, and for disseminating truth, as well as for
ministering comfort and edification.<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>An entirely opposite view is often taken, especially
by Dissenting writers. Mr. Horder even regards the
definite assertion of the doctrine of the Trinity in
Heber&rsquo;s greatest hymn as &lsquo;its only fault.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>
Dr. Martineau argued that to eliminate from a hymn its
distinctive doctrinal teaching, and to &lsquo;translate&rsquo; it into
broader theological language, was &lsquo;simply to remove
an obstruction,&rsquo; and to introduce the author &lsquo;to the
veneration of thousands, to whom otherwise he must appear as a repulsive
stranger.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
The general question of alterations in the text of hymns may be considered
later. At the moment I need only point out that the
apostolic ideal of a hymn includes both ethical and
doctrinal teaching. John Wesley prided himself upon
having given in his hymn-book &lsquo;a little body of experimental
and practical divinity.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>The same principle may be applied to hymns of
invitation, of which there are so many in the Methodist
collection, and of which Faber&rsquo;s &lsquo;Souls of men, why
will ye scatter?&rsquo; is the best modern example. An
off-hand criticism may condemn hymns addressed to
our own souls, to &lsquo;souls of men,&rsquo; to &lsquo;neighbours and
friends,&rsquo; to &lsquo;sinners poor and wretched;&rsquo; but they have
ample warrant both in precept and precedent.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God sent His singers upon earth</p>
<p class="t0">With songs of sadness and of mirth,</p>
<p class="t0">That they might touch the hearts of men,</p>
<p class="t0">And bring them back to heaven again.<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The Christian poet is a teacher and an evangelist.</p>
<p class="tb">Passing from the form to the character of the hymn,
there are certain great principles concerning which
there will, I imagine, be little difference of opinion.
The first essential in every hymn is surely that it
be not unworthy of use in the service of God, who
is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and is to be
worshipped in the beauty of holiness. There must be&mdash;</p>
<p>1. <i>Sincerity.</i>&mdash;Fitness for divine service depends
not upon beauty of form or expression, but upon
sincerity of thought.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The fineness which a hymn or psalm affords,</p>
<p class="t0">Is when the soul unto the lines accords.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
</div>
<p>&lsquo;The garment of praise&rsquo; is the white robe of the pure
in heart, and, lacking this, the stately anthem has less
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
of heaven&rsquo;s music than the discordant voices of the
village choir.</p>
<p>So Cowper prays&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Forgive the praise that falls so low</p>
<p class="t0">Beneath the gratitude I owe:</p>
<p class="t0">It means Thy praise, however poor;</p>
<p class="t0">An angel&rsquo;s song could do no more.</p>
</div>
<p>So Keble sings&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Childlike though the voices be,</p>
<p class="t">And untunable the parts,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wilt own the minstrelsy</p>
<p class="t">If it flows from childlike hearts.</p>
</div>
<p>Sincerity requires that the thoughts expressed should
be real to the singer as well as to the poet. They
may not be such as would have occurred to him, and
the expression may be altogether beyond his powers
of origination, but they must be such as he can think
in his best moments or may be helped to enter into at
the hour of prayer. Sincerity does not require that all
our hymns should be on the lowest level common to
a general congregation, but that the sentiment expressed,
the emotion presupposed or to be excited, be suited to
the heart of man in the presence of his Father in
heaven. In the compilation of a hymn-book something
must be left to the good sense and judgement
of those who are to use it; and there is no part of public
worship which calls for more serious and intelligent
consideration than the selection of hymns suited to
the occasion and to the congregation.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>It is perhaps too much to say that sincerity also
requires that the writer of a hymn should be not
unworthy of a place in the Christian choir. Happily
this question rarely arises. The author&rsquo;s name is often
an aid to devotion, and in most hymn-books there is
hardly a name&mdash;except Dryden&rsquo;s&mdash;that seems wholly
unfitted to this sacred service.</p>
<p>2. <i>Reverence.</i>&mdash;&lsquo;God is in heaven, and thou upon
earth: therefore let thy words be few,&rsquo; restrained,
seemly. The profoundest reverence, the lowliest adoration,
shrinks from utterance when it hears and sees
unspeakable things. This is sublimely taught in those
great lines of Dante:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here memory mocks the toil of genius. Christ</p>
<p class="t0">Beamed on that cross; and pattern fails me now.</p>
<p class="t0">But whoso takes his cross, and follows Christ,</p>
<p class="t0">Will pardon me for that I leave untold,</p>
<p class="t0">When in the fleckered dawning he shall spy</p>
<p class="t0">The glitterance of Christ.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Even so profuse a hymn-writer as Watts feels that
there are times when it is best to &lsquo;leave untold&rsquo; what
the heart most desires to tell:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A solemn reverence checks our songs,</p>
<p class="t0">And praise sits silent on our tongues.</p>
</div>
<p>It is a less sublime, but not less acceptable, form of
worship which attempts that which yet it knows to be
impossible. Praise must be heard in Zion lest if men
hold their peace the very stones should cry out. Nor
<span class="pb" id="Page_19">19</span>
is it right that awe should silence love. We worship
the King, eternal, immortal, invisible, yet even so we
praise Him who &lsquo;like as a Father pitieth His children&rsquo;;
and when we sing praise to Christ as God, we remember
that He called His disciples not servants, but friends.</p>
<p>Dr. Watts utters the thought of many hearts in one
of his finest hymns&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Join all the glorious names</p>
<p class="t2">Of wisdom, love, and power,</p>
<p class="t">That ever mortals knew,</p>
<p class="t2">That angels ever bore;</p>
<p class="t0">All are too mean to speak His worth,</p>
<p class="t0">Too mean to set my Saviour forth.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">But O what gentle terms,</p>
<p class="t2">What condescending ways,</p>
<p class="t">Doth our Redeemer use,</p>
<p class="t2">To teach His heavenly grace;</p>
<p class="t0">Mine eyes with joy and wonder see</p>
<p class="t0">What forms of love He bears for me!</p>
</div>
<p>It would be easy to give illustrations of offences
against the spirit of reverence, especially in hymns
of the eighteenth century and the earlier part of the
nineteenth. The Moravian hymns in particular were
often disfigured by the most revolting phrases, so had
indeed that one does not care to give them even the
notoriety of emphatic condemnation.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a> But such gross
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
offences are rare in our time, and are practically
unknown to Protestant hymnals. Some of the Romish
hymns, and a few in Anglican books, refer to the
details of our Lord&rsquo;s Incarnation and Passion with
irreverent and even indecent realism, and those
addressed to the Virgin Mary are often as bad as
any found in the older Moravian books.</p>
<p>We are, on the other hand, in some danger of
carrying our sense of what is reverent too far, and
of altering without reason the glowing words of
devout Christian affection. John Wesley shrank from
including</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesu, Lover of my soul</p>
</div>
<p>in his <i>Collection</i>. The expression is quoted from
Wisd. xi. 26: &lsquo;But Thou sparest all; for they are
Thine, O Lord, Thou Lover of souls&rsquo;; and he saw
no objection to its general application as in the
lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lover of souls, to rescue mine</p>
<p class="t0">Reveal the charity divine</p>
<p class="t">That suffered in my stead.</p>
</div>
<p>Canon Ellerton hesitated as to the propriety of the
inclusion of this great hymn in a Church hymnal, and
spoke of it as standing &lsquo;absolutely <i>upon</i> the line&rsquo;
which separates hymns for public worship from those
of private devotion. But the Church in all its borders
has decided the question, and our heart tells us that
the decision is right. Nor is it, indeed, a hymn solely
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
for the sanctuary and the saint; it is a hymn for the
street and for the sinner.<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>The epithet &lsquo;dear&rsquo; is not one to be scattered
thoughtlessly through hymns and prayers. Yet there
are lines from which it is almost an impiety to remove
it. There is a language of reverent affection
which has in it nothing of the earth.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come then, and to my soul reveal</p>
<p class="t">The heights and depths of grace,</p>
<p class="t0">The wounds which all my sorrows heal,</p>
<p class="t">That dear disfigured face.</p>
</div>
<p>Personally I should not touch even Faber&rsquo;s</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sweet Saviour, bless us e&rsquo;er we go,</p>
</div>
<p>though I wish he had used another epithet; and I
certainly could not draw a rough pen through Cowper&rsquo;s
tender line</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood</p>
<p class="t">Shall never lose its power.</p>
</div>
<p>There is something due to the men who wrote thus.
If they loved much, we should let them speak their
love to all the ages in terms of strong affection, and
our colder hearts may learn to burn within us as we
draw near with them to Him who &lsquo;sought us Himself
with such longing and love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Bad taste is an error of judgement, not irreverence,
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
but it has very much the same effect upon the worshipper,
and it is to be regretted that some very great
hymns, consecrated by ten thousand sacred memories,
are marred by phrases which will not bear comment
or meditation. If the hymn were new, not many
modern books would include Cowper&rsquo;s lines</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There is a fountain filled with blood,</p>
<p class="t">Drawn from Immanuel&rsquo;s veins;</p>
</div>
<p>but nothing could long preserve in common use Watts&rsquo;s
verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">His dying crimson like a robe</p>
<p class="t">Spreads o&rsquo;er His body on the tree;</p>
<p class="t0">Then am I dead to all the globe,</p>
<p class="t">And all the globe is dead to me.</p>
</div>
<p>3. Closely allied to reverence is <i>Dignity</i>, the elevation
and refinement of thought and language which
beseem the worship of God. Nor is it any disadvantage
to the less enlightened or less educated in the
Christian assembly that they should learn to speak
the language of the family of God. Dignity is not
necessarily obscure or pompous. It represents what
is worthy of man&rsquo;s thought when it is engaged on the
highest of all themes. The intrusion into the most
sacred moments of what is mean or vulgar in sound or
association is a grievous offence. Hymns belong to
the <i>belles lettres</i> of the literature of devotion; to be
familiar with them should be in itself a liberal
education.</p>
<p>4. <i>Beauty.</i>&mdash;&lsquo;Intercourse between God and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_23">23</span>
human soul,&rsquo; said Dr. Johnson, &lsquo;cannot be poetical&rsquo;&mdash;a
characteristically dogmatic assertion for which there
might be some excuse in his day, but which succeeding
years have overwhelmingly disproved. A hundred
years ago it was necessary to include in a hymn-book
compositions that compensated for their lack of
poetry by their undoubted piety, but we have such
a wealth of song at our disposal that there need be
nothing poor, prosaic, commonplace in our hymnals.
Watts&rsquo;s greatest error was his excessive tenderness for
&lsquo;vulgar capacities.&rsquo;</p>
<p>5. <i>Simplicity.</i>&mdash;We may say of great hymns what
Tennyson said of great men&mdash;they are</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In their simplicity sublime.</p>
</div>
<p>Heavy words are rightly to be regarded as fatal
to a good hymn. Charles Wesley was peculiarly prone
to use words which make hymns impossible in public
worship. Who desires in prayer or praise to use
such words as &lsquo;consentaneous,&rsquo; &lsquo;implunged,&rsquo; &lsquo;choral
symphonies&rsquo;?</p>
<p>The best hymns are made up of short words, and
have a large preponderance of monosyllables. The
words, too, should be such as men use in the more
serious intercourse of daily life. It goes without saying
that colloquialisms and words with mean associations
are not fit for the sanctuary, but the finest hymns are
often those which the plain man recognizes as written
in his own tongue.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>Bishop Ken&rsquo;s great hymns are models of simple
directness of thought and expression, and so are some
verses of Pope&rsquo;s <i>Universal Prayer</i>.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What conscience dictates to be done,</p>
<p class="t">Or warns me not to do;</p>
<p class="t0">This, teach me more than hell to shun,</p>
<p class="t">That, more than heaven pursue.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If I am right, Thy grace impart,</p>
<p class="t">Still in the right to stay;</p>
<p class="t0">If I am wrong, oh teach my heart</p>
<p class="t">To find that better way!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Teach me to feel another&rsquo;s woe,</p>
<p class="t">To hide the fault I see;</p>
<p class="t0">That mercy I to others show,</p>
<p class="t">That mercy show to me.</p>
</div>
<p>6. <i>Fervour.</i>&mdash;If there is no fire or glow in a hymn,
it might as well be prose as poetry. Indeed, many
hymns are so prosaic, so <i>wooden</i>, that it is difficult to
see how they can ever</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Teach our faint desires to rise</p>
</div>
<p>above the dullest levels of devotion. There should be
in a hymn a restrained fervour, a reverent rapture
of poetic inspiration free from all admixture of the
sensuous and morbidly emotional. &lsquo;Be not drunken
with wine ... but be filled with the Spirit.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Quench then the altar-fires of your old gods,</p>
<p class="t">Quench not the fire within.<a class="fn" id="fr_29" href="#fn_29">[29]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>Nay, rather, if we find no &lsquo;minstrel rapture&rsquo; for the
praise of the Most High, may we not ask with Charles
Wesley&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Why breaks not out the fire within,</p>
<p class="t">In flames of joy, and praise, and love?</p>
</div>
<p>As might be expected, it is among the Anglican
and the rationalistic communities that there is the
greatest dread of the emotional in worship. Yet
Dr. Martineau is the ablest apologist for fervour in
religious poetry.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The editor of a hymn-book will not think it necessary
to graduate the fervour, the imaginativeness, the
grandeur of the compositions admitted into his volume,
by the cold, level, and prosaic condition of mind which
may possibly prevail among some who use it. Thus, to
damp the fire down to the temperature of the fuel, seems
to offer but a small prospect of kindling anything. We
must not thus forgo the glorious power which art exercises
in worship. Its peculiar function in connexion with
religion is to substitute for the poor and low thoughts of
ordinary men, the solemn and vivid images of things
invisible that have revealed themselves to loftier souls, and
to present the objects of faith before the general mind in
something of that aspect under which they rise up before
the great artists of poetry and of sound. These gifted men
are to lift us; we are not to depress them. In sacred music
we acknowledge this principle at once; we confess that it is
a noble thing, when we think of the origin of things, and
call God the Creator, to have within us the mighty transitions
of Haydn&rsquo;s genius instead of our own puny dreams;
to have the incidents of sacred story glow and live before us
at the touch of a power like that of Handel or of Spohr;
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
to find ourselves, at such bidding, with the &lsquo;Shepherds
abiding in the field,&rsquo; not far from the holy chant falling
on the midnight air; or to hear in a voice, melting as
Christ&rsquo;s, &lsquo;Come unto Me, ye weary&rsquo;; or, as we pass from
bereavement to bereavement of this world, to be haunted,
as with a sudden peace, by the echo of that unearthly
strain, &lsquo;Blest are the departed.&rsquo; Not less elevating is the
poetry than the melody of faith, when it is equally left
alone with its first fresh power, and not reduced halfway to
prose as a condition of its entrance into worship.<a class="fn" id="fr_30" href="#fn_30">[30]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We should, perhaps, hesitate to say that a Christian
hymn may have the &lsquo;fine, careless rapture&rsquo; which is
the glory of Browning&rsquo;s thrush, but we must not deny
to it the &lsquo;inward glee&rsquo; as well as the &lsquo;serious faith&rsquo; of
Wordsworth&rsquo;s stock-dove. The fervour of Christian
song is the bright expression of our glorying in the
Lord.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sing we merrily unto God our Strength.<a class="fn" id="fr_31" href="#fn_31">[31]</a></p>
</div>
<p>7. <i>Truth</i> of doctrine.&mdash;If it be allowed that hymns
play an important part in the teaching of the
Church, it is hardly necessary to press this point.
Indeed, there is often more to be feared from theological
pedantry than from doctrinal sensitiveness.
The essential unity of the faith of Christendom is
nowhere better illustrated than in the number of
hymns which belong to the common treasure of the
Church. There is already a union of hearts in the
language of devotion which is the surest promise of
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
the reunion of Christendom. At the same time, there
are not a few hymns which must either be excluded
from denominational hymn-books, or be revised into
accord with the faith of the congregations that are to
use them.</p>
<p>I well remember the distress of a distinguished
Independent minister when I quoted to him Wesley&rsquo;s
verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ah! Lord, with trembling I confess,</p>
<p class="t0">A gracious soul may fall from grace;</p>
<p class="t0">The salt may lose its seasoning power,</p>
<p class="t0">And never, never find it more&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>and the pained incredulity with which he deprecated
my assurance that the hymn was still in use in our
congregations. I remember, too, how abruptly an
eminent Methodist minister closed his hymn-book
and directed the congregation to cease singing when
he found them approaching the last verse of one of
Toplady&rsquo;s hymns&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Yes, I to the end shall endure,</p>
<p class="t">As sure as the earnest is given,</p>
<p class="t0">More happy but not more secure</p>
<p class="t">The glorified spirits in heaven.</p>
</div>
<p>The verses set forth accurately and appropriately
the teaching of the Churches to which the hymns
respectively belong, but they are impossible in other
theological regions. A very wide range should be
allowed to religious thought as expressed in hymns,
but those which contradict the things most surely
<span class="pb" id="Page_28">28</span>
believed in a Church are rightly excluded from its
hymnal.</p>
<p>8. We should add, I think, if not to the essentials,
yet certainly to the virtues of a good hymn, <i>Scriptural
language</i>. Our greatest prose writers have found in
the English Bible the most effective, forceful, impressive
words; and the hymn-writer has the advantage
not only of its pure, strong diction, but also
of the hallowed associations which the words of Holy
Scripture preserve for all Englishmen.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<h2 id="ch3"><span class="h2line1">II</span>
<br />Hymns of the Bible and the Early Church</h2>
<p>The hymn-book of the modern Church is the
direct descendant of the Hebrew Psalter. Had
David and Asaph never sung, the hymns of
Watts and Wesley, of Keble and Montgomery, could
hardly have been written. If the praises of Israel had
not rung through the courts of the Temple, the choir of
the Christian Church would have been silent. Primitive
Christianity struggled hard to free itself from the
swathing-bands of Jewish ritual; but it recognized
from the first the riches of its inheritance in the Book
of Psalms. There, more than in any other Scripture,
the first Christians heard &lsquo;the voice of Christ and His
Church.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_32" href="#fn_32">[32]</a> Our Lord Himself joined in singing these
ancient hymns, and bade His disciples understand that
all things must needs be fulfilled which &lsquo;were written
in the ... psalms&rsquo; concerning Him. St. Paul and
St. James alike commend the singing of psalms, and
thus, without controversy, the Psalter was claimed by
the Church as her own. The determination to hear the
voice of Christ everywhere, led to extravagances of
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
exposition which a more critical age cannot tolerate,
but it gave the psalms a firm hold upon the heart of
Christendom. The ancient Scriptures would have
passed away with the &lsquo;worldly sanctuary&rsquo; had it not
been for the witness of the priest, the prophet, and the
psalmist to Christ.</p>
<p>Religious poetry and song must long have preceded
any collection of psalms or hymns. One would like
to know who first, in the far-off days, said to his
brother, &lsquo;O come, let us sing unto the Lord&rsquo;; but that
unknown poet or musician had been famous and forgotten
before history was born. The first Hebrew
psalm is the Song of Moses at the Red Sea, the earliest
of the triumph songs of the people of God, the hymns
which celebrate Jehovah, who ever showeth Himself
&lsquo;a God of deliverances.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_33" href="#fn_33">[33]</a> Sung first to &lsquo;the loud timbrel
by Egypt&rsquo;s dark sea,&rsquo; it becomes in the Apocalypse the
Song of Moses and of the Lamb, chanted to the harps
of God by the glassy sea mingled with fire. At the first
the singers are the congregation, not yet a people,
whom Moses brought out of Egypt in haste; at the last
they are the white-robed army of them that have gotten
the victory through the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I will sing unto the Lord, for He hath triumphed gloriously:</p>
<p class="t0">The horse and his rider hath He thrown into the sea.</p>
<p class="t0">The Lord is my strength and song,</p>
<p class="t0">And He is become my salvation:</p>
<p class="t0">This is my God, and I will praise Him;</p>
<p class="t0">My father&rsquo;s God, and I will exalt Him.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Who is like unto Thee, O Lord, among the gods?</p>
<p class="t0">Who is like Thee, glorious in holiness,</p>
<p class="t0">Fearful in praises, doing wonders?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of Thine inheritance,</p>
<p class="t0">The place, O Lord, which Thou hast made for Thee to dwell in,</p>
<p class="t0">The sanctuary, O Lord, which Thy hands have established.</p>
<p class="t0">The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.<a class="fn" id="fr_34" href="#fn_34">[34]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Moses, then, is the first singer in the Christian
choir; and if to this song of triumph we can add the
90th Psalm, we may well place Moses amongst the
sweetest and the sublimest of hymn-writers.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear</p>
<p class="t0">The Godhead&rsquo;s most benignant grace.<a class="fn" id="fr_35" href="#fn_35">[35]</a></p>
</div>
<p>But Moses is not the founder of Hebrew psalmody.
The fact that he and others may have written psalms
does not detract from the fame of David, &lsquo;the sweet
psalmist of Israel.&rsquo; It was he who won for the psalm
a permanent place in the worship of God. It is not
for me to discuss here critical questions in regard to
the Davidic authorship of particular psalms; but
I venture to deprecate a too ready or complete acceptance
of Wellhausen&rsquo;s phrase that the Psalter was &lsquo;the
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
hymn-book of the second temple,&rsquo; as though it settled
the question of the existence of previous Psalters used
in the days before the Exile. Unless we are prepared
to reject history and tradition alike, David must still
hold his place amongst the singers of the Church of
God.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There David stands, with harp in hand,</p>
<p class="t0">As master of the choir.</p>
</div>
<p>The builders of the great vanished cities of the olden
time, of its palaces and pyramids; the founders of its
monarchies, empires, and republics, pass into oblivion
or preserve at best the dull memorial of a name in
history; but &lsquo;he who sang the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s song&rsquo; has
an audience that never wearies, though the individual
listeners pass in solemn and ceaseless order to the silent
land. For man is one everywhere and in all ages.
The accidents of life vary, but its essence abides. &lsquo;The
universal Church of Christ hath given its witness that
these psalms are not made for one age, but for all ages;
not for one place, but for all places; not for one soul,
but for all souls.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_36" href="#fn_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>The contention that David&rsquo;s history is not consistent
with the high religious tone of the poems ascribed to
him need not disturb us. The man who wrote the
<i>Lament</i> for Saul and Jonathan was no mere brigand
chief, but one who wore &lsquo;the graces that adorn a king,&rsquo;
and as a poet and a friend deserves to rank with Milton
and with Tennyson.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!</p>
<p class="t0">Jonathan is slain upon thy high places.</p>
<p class="t0">I am distressed for thee, my brother Jonathan:</p>
<p class="t0">Very pleasant hast thou been unto me:</p>
<p class="t0">Thy love to me was wonderful,</p>
<p class="t0">Passing the love of women.</p>
<p class="t0">How are the mighty fallen,</p>
<p class="t0">And the weapons of war perished!</p>
<p class="lr">2 Sam. i. 25-27.</p>
</div>
<p>Is there not the same note in David as in Milton, the
same lingering on the loved name, the same reiteration
of the words of sorrow?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,</p>
<p class="t0">Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer:</p>
<p class="t0">Who would not sing for Lycidas?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">But, O the heavy change, now thou art gone,</p>
<p class="t0">Now thou art gone, and never must return!</p>
</div>
<p>Jonathan is shrined as richly and as unfadingly as
Edward King or Arthur Hallam, and we may well
believe that the man whom Jonathan loved as his own
soul loved God from his inmost heart&mdash;that the author
of the <i>Lament</i> was the singer of the 18th Psalm. And
if it be allowed that David wrote that song&mdash;&lsquo;the Psalm
of Clovis and John Wesley&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_37" href="#fn_37">[37]</a>&mdash;it is difficult, merely on
the ground of personal character, to deny him any psalm
in the whole book.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I love Thee, O Lord, my strength.</p>
<p class="t0">The Lord is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer;</p>
<p class="t0">My God, my strong rock, in Him will I trust;</p>
<p class="t0">My shield, and the horn of my salvation, my high tower.</p>
<p class="t0">I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p class="t0">So shall I be saved from mine enemies.</p>
<p class="t0">In my distress I called upon the Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">And cried unto my God:</p>

<p class="t0">And my cry before Him came into His ears.</p>
<p class="t0">Then the earth shook and trembled,</p>
<p class="t0">The foundations also of the mountains moved</p>
<p class="t0">And were shaken, because He was wroth.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">He delivered me from my strong enemy,</p>
<p class="t0">And from them that hated me, for they were too mighty for me.</p>
<p class="t0">They came upon me in the day of my calamity:</p>
<p class="t0">But the Lord was my stay.</p>
<p class="t0">He brought me forth also into a large place;</p>
<p class="t0">He delivered me, because He delighted in me.</p>
</div>
<p>It may be true that the value of the psalms to the
Church does not depend upon the settlement, one way
or another, of the rival claims of singers before and
after the Exile, yet the question is of vastly more than
mere literary or historic interest. We lose much if
we lose David and the psalmists of the kingdom from
&lsquo;the glorious choir&rsquo; which sings for ever the praises of
Israel&rsquo;s God and David&rsquo;s Son. And we are all the
poorer if the sources of Christian song are to be sought,
not by</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t4">Siloa&rsquo;s brook that flowed</p>
<p class="t0">Fast by the oracles of God,</p>
</div>
<p>but by the dull canals of Babylon, where the exiled
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
people wept when they remembered Zion. Even the
most extreme of modern English critics tells us that,
&lsquo;As mere academical exercises, by not merely unnamed
but unknown individuals, the psalms will
neither edify the Church nor charm the literary
student.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_38" href="#fn_38">[38]</a> But, after all, we have not yet lost our
fellowship with the men of David&rsquo;s time. The psalms
are to us a memorial of the golden days of Israel&rsquo;s
history. They are still to us, as to Francis Davison,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hymns which in the Hebrew tongue</p>
<p class="t2">First were sung</p>
<p class="t0">By Israel&rsquo;s sweet and royal singer.</p>
</div>
<p>Or, to put the case in prose:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Both poetry and music existed before David&rsquo;s time,
and poetry had been carried to a high development in such
compositions as Exod. xv. and Judges v. But with David
a new era of religious poetry commenced. The personal
element entered into it. It became the instrument of the
soul&rsquo;s communion with God.<a class="fn" id="fr_39" href="#fn_39">[39]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is this &lsquo;personal element&rsquo; which makes the Psalter
a living book in every age.</p>
<p>The earlier Hebrew psalmists, even when they
wrote in view of the imposing ritual of the temple
service with its crowded choir, its thousand white-robed
priests sounding their silver trumpets, were
never bound by a narrow conventional opinion as to
what beseemed the order of public worship. Fettered
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
by rule and rubric as the later Jewish Church was, the
psalmist as well as the prophet stands for the right of
the individual soul to enter alone into the presence of
God.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Speak to Him, thou, for He hears,</p>
<p class="t0">And spirit with Spirit can meet.</p>
</div>
<p>The personal element is, in some respects, the most
precious gift of the Psalter to Christianity. Had the
hymns of the mediaeval Church, instead of the Hebrew
Psalter, been the pattern for modern hymn-writers, we
should have lost the best, the grandest, the most abiding
of modern hymns. But the revival of hymn-writing,
alike in Germany and in England, was a result of the
Protestant Reformation, which set aside ecclesiastical
in favour of Biblical precedents; so our hymn-books
are inspired by the Psalter, not the Breviary. And
this vindication of the rights of the individual soul
we owe in the first instance to David, or to the men
who wrote the psalms ascribed to him. As Edward
Irving has said, with his majestic and unrestrained
eloquence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The force of his character was vast, and the scope of
his life was immense. His harp was full-stringed, and
every angel of joy and of sorrow swept over the chords as
he passed. Such oceans of affection lay within his breast
as could not always slumber in their calmness. For the
hearts of a hundred men strove and struggled together
within the narrow continent of his single heart.<a class="fn" id="fr_40" href="#fn_40">[40]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>Bishop Christopher Wordsworth, in the elaborate
preface to his <i>Holy Year</i>, says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The pronouns <i>I</i> and <i>my</i> are rarely found in any ancient
Church hymn. But in modern hymns the individual often
detaches and isolates himself from the body of the faithful,
and in a spirit of sentimental selfishness obtrudes his own
feelings concerning himself.<a class="fn" id="fr_41" href="#fn_41">[41]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is an entirely superficial criticism, though,
in greater or less degree, it has been accepted in
many modern hymn-books. It is unsound in principle,
and contrary to the highest precedents, ancient and
modern. It is the personal element that makes a
hymn dear to the congregation of Christ&rsquo;s flock. It
is the fit expression of profound individual experience
that gives a hymn its charm for the multitude, who
can think poetry, but cannot write it. Perhaps no
hymn of the last century has touched more hearts than
Newman&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lead, kindly Light&rsquo;; yet it was written as
a personal prayer, giving expression to a special and
temporary experience. Few hymns better illustrate
the appropriateness to others of the experience of one.
In his later years, Newman declined, almost querulously,
to be &lsquo;examined&rsquo; as to what he meant exactly
by the closing lines of his famous hymn, written in
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
a &lsquo;transient&rsquo; state of mind, &lsquo;when home-sick or sea-sick&rsquo;;
but to Mrs. Tait, who inscribed the lines</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And with the morn those angel faces smile</p>
<p class="t0">Which I have loved long since and lost awhile</p>
</div>
<p>beneath the portrait of the children taken so suddenly
from the desolated Deanery at Carlisle, no lapse of
years could ever dull their meaning. The poet often
speaks &lsquo;not of himself,&rsquo; and his words may be truer
as well as richer to the man who repeats than to the
man who wrote them. A formal service, performed by
professionals or by the technically &lsquo;religious,&rsquo; may find
suitable expression in general terms; but the Christian
congregation</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Learns the use of <i>I</i> and <i>me</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>The grandest of all hymns, ancient and modern, throb
with individual life, whether they soar to heaven on
the wings of ecstasy, or bow to earth beneath an overwhelming
sense of sinfulness.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bless the Lord, O my soul,</p>
<p class="t0">And all that is within me bless His holy name.</p>

<p class="t0">And renew a right spirit within me.</p>
<p class="t0">Cast me not away from Thy presence,</p>
<p class="t0">And take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Lord is my Shepherd,</p>
<p class="t">I shall not want.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O happy day that fixed my choice</p>
<p class="t0">On Thee, my Saviour and my God!</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou, O Christ, art all I want,</p>
<p class="t0">More than all in Thee I find.</p>
</div>
<p>Some of the most sublime passages in ancient chant and
modern hymn are those in which the singer turns from
the confession of a common sin or the expression of a
common gratitude to claim a personal share in it. Even
that greatest hymn of the Church&rsquo;s public worship,
the &lsquo;Te Deum Laudamus,&rsquo; voices at last the cry of the
individual believer&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In Thee, O Lord, have I hoped; let me not be ashamed for ever.</p>
</div>
<p>So Charles Wesley, celebrating the first anniversary of
his conversion, sings&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He breaks the power of cancelled sin,</p>
<p class="t">He sets the prisoner free;</p>
<p class="t0">His blood can make the foulest clean,</p>
<p class="t">His blood availed for me.</p>
</div>
<p>So Thomas Olivers at the end of his great anthem to
the God of Abraham adds his own voice to the voices
of the celestial choir&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">The whole triumphant host</p>
<p class="t">Give thanks to God most high:</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Hail, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t3">They ever cry:</p>
<p class="t">Hail, Abraham&rsquo;s God and <i>mine</i>!</p>
<p class="t">I join the heavenly lays.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>The contrast between the liturgical hymn written for
others to sing and the hymn of personal experience, the
pouring out of the soul before God, is well illustrated in
the Psalter; e.g. compare Ps. cxv.&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but unto Thy name give glory,</p>
<p class="t0">For Thy mercy, and for Thy truth&rsquo;s sake.</p>
</div>
<p>with Ps. cxvi.&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I love the Lord, because He hath heard</p>
<p class="t0">My voice and my supplications.</p>
</div>
<p>It is in the earlier psalms, though not in them exclusively,
that we find the personal element conspicuous,
and it is those psalms which have inspired the highest
forms of Christian song.</p>
<p>Even in psalms written for the congregation and
with direct liturgical intent there is often the introduction
of the personal element, as in Ps. cvi.</p>
<p>In the Book of Psalms we have not only the cry of
the seeker after God, but the voice of the Church in its
common prayer and praise. We find here, too, hymns
for the Sabbath day and other festivals, hymns in commemoration
of the older saints, national prayers and
anthems, which confess the sin of the people or record
the mighty works of God, setting the nation&rsquo;s history to
music. Indeed, it is difficult to discover in modern
hymn-books any hymn which has not its prototype in
the Psalter, though the Incarnation and its manifold
revelation brought into Christian life and thought
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
a light that far outshines the brightest stars of the
earlier dispensation.</p>
<p>Like other great hymn-books, the Hebrew Psalter
grew by stages and gathered into its treasury things
new and old. In its final form it is a collection of
hymns ancient and modern&mdash;a fusion of various hymn-books,
in which, as in other collections, there is
occasional repetition, free quotation of one writer from
another, reminiscences of familiar psalms of earlier
psalmists, and evidences of the exercise of a wide
editorial discretion in revision and emendation.</p>
<p>We should like to know something of the man who
edited the final <i>Collection of Hymns for the use of the
people called Jews</i>. If he had written a preface, or
even a title-page, he would have solved for us many
interesting literary questions&mdash;though he would have
added little to the spiritual or liturgical value of the
Psalter. It is enough for us to know that the psalms
as we sing them to-day are the Psalms of which our
Lord spoke, when He appealed to them as witnesses
with Moses and the prophets to His mission. It was
a hymn-book ready for use in the Church of Pentecost,
and was adopted in its worship from the beginning.</p>
<p class="tb">The influence of the Psalter upon Christian
hymnody extends far beyond the use of the rhythmic
psalms. The metrical versions, which long supplied
the place of hymn-books, gave to the Psalms a double
share in Christian worship. Even to-day, when the
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
metrical Psalter has lost its hold upon the Christian
congregation, many of our greatest hymns are versions
of Hebrew psalms. Nor is the rhythmic version outworn.
No complete order of Christian worship is
possible which does not include at least some portion
of the Psalter in one or other of our three grand English
renderings.<a class="fn" id="fr_42" href="#fn_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>The birth of the Lord Jesus was marked, as so many
critical periods have been, by a &lsquo;sudden blaze of song.&rsquo;
The choir of heaven itself sang the &lsquo;Gloria in Excelsis&rsquo;;
Mary chanted the &lsquo;Magnificat&rsquo;; Zacharias, the &lsquo;Benedictus&rsquo;;
whilst Simeon&rsquo;s swan-song, the &lsquo;Nunc Dimittis,&rsquo;
closed the rich though scanty hymnody of that great
transition time.</p>
<p>The apostolic Church had no David. The Epistles
preserve for us some few lines of early Christian
hymns; but it was left to later times to give its
sublimest songs to the Christian choir. Yet, if for
a moment we think of what might have been, surely
St. Paul could have written battle-songs grand as
Luther&rsquo;s; St. Luke, an earlier <i>Christian Year</i>; and
St. Peter might have sung with the simple pathos of
John Newton. But though other gifts were theirs in
abundance, the gift of song was not bestowed upon
them; and since the apostolic Church had no poet, the
New Testament has no Psalter. Nor, indeed, does it
<span class="pb" id="Page_43">43</span>
need one; for God&rsquo;s great poem, His sublimest work,
is the Man Christ Jesus.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And so the Word had breath, and wrought</p>
<p class="t">With human hands the creed of creeds</p>
<p class="t">In loveliness of perfect deeds</p>
<p class="t0">More strong than all poetic thought.</p>
</div>
<p>But though the primitive Church had no great
hymn-book, it had its ephemeral &lsquo;songs and solos,&rsquo;
its minor poets who helped many an earnest worshipper
to draw nigh to God with the voice of a psalm.
Indeed, there is some reason to think that the
Corinthian Church suffered from too great a number
of would-be poets, for there &lsquo;every one&rsquo; had &lsquo;a psalm,&rsquo;
and St. Paul would obviously have liked to issue, as
John Wesley actually did, a rule against the giving out
of hymns of the preacher&rsquo;s own composing.</p>
<p>The fragments that remain of the hymns of the
apostolic age are few and uncertain. The most distinctly
rhythmic is the short creed, which may have
been said or sung, found in 1 Tim. iii. 16&mdash;</p>

<p>It is very possible that the metrical structure of
St. Matthew&rsquo;s version may to some extent explain its
variations from St. Luke.</p>
<p>&lsquo;The hymns of the Apocalypse show, strange to
say, no metrical arrangement of diction,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_44" href="#fn_44">[44]</a> but their
influence upon Christian song has been great. Thus
the New Testament makes a most important, though
chiefly indirect, contribution to the hymnal of the
Church.</p>
<p class="tb">St. Paul&rsquo;s division of religious poetry into &lsquo;psalms,
hymns, and spiritual songs&rsquo; indicates the character and
variety of the songs of the apostolic Church, but gives
little information concerning its hymnals. We may
assume, however, that whilst the Hebrew Psalter formed
the first and greatest section of the songs of the Church,
there were also a number of recognized &lsquo;hymns&rsquo; and
&lsquo;odes,&rsquo; to which additions might at any time be made.
By the law of spiritual selection these ancient hymns
have passed out of the literature of the Church; they
perished in the using, and having served their own
generation according to the will of God fell on sleep.</p>
<p>The Church universal is indebted to the liturgical
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
Churches for the inclusion in their Books of Common
Prayer of the psalms which heralded the dawn of the
day of the Son of Man. It is surely a narrow and
superficial notion of divine worship which would
exclude such canticles from our services as archaic or
artificial.</p>
<p>How beautiful, for example, is the &lsquo;Nunc Dimittis&rsquo;
whether sung daily at eventide, or when the day of life
is ended and the Lord now letteth His servant depart
in peace! It is in Christian usage what the sounding of
&lsquo;The Last Post&rsquo; is to the British soldier, marking the
close of the common day or sounding the last farewell
to a comrade whose warfare is accomplished. A petty
and prosaic criticism may regard as unreal such
adaptations of ancient hymns, though consecrated by
many centuries&rsquo; use, but there is as legitimate a poet&rsquo;s
licence in devotion as in literature.</p>
<p>The Old and New Testament alike, though the
former more directly than the latter, gave to hymns a
place in the worship of God. But the new wine of the
gospel, which burst the wine-skins of out-worn ritual,
could not be contained even in the golden chalice of the
Psalter or the canticles written on its models.</p>
<p>Distinctively Christian hymns which, as we have
seen, are occasionally quoted in the Epistles, and are
referred to as a recognized part of public and social
worship, date from the earliest times. The famous
letter of the younger Pliny to Trajan tells how those
who were terrified into the denial of their Lord,
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
confessed no worse crime than that of meeting on an
appointed day before the dawn to sing antiphonal
hymns to Christ as to a god.<a class="fn" id="fr_45" href="#fn_45">[45]</a> Judaism had its
Messianic psalms, but the hymns which give praise to
Christ as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God made Man for man to die</p>
</div>
<p>are the glory of the new dispensation. The early
defenders of catholic doctrine appealed without hesitation
to the fact that &lsquo;whatever psalms and hymns were
written by the brethren from the beginning, celebrate
Christ the Word of God by asserting His divinity.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_46" href="#fn_46">[46]</a></p>
<p>Orthodox and heretic alike&mdash;perhaps the heretic
especially&mdash;sought to win acceptance for his teaching,
to fix it in the memory of the congregation by setting
it to music. The famous heretic Arius (d. 336) disseminated
his doctrine in hymns which are said to have
been written in metres associated with the most
licentious songs. They were answered by the orthodox
hymns of Ambrose. Later heretics, like Apollinaris,
Bishop of Laodicea (d. 390), followed his example;
whilst St. Augustine himself wrote an acrostic hymn
or psalm against Donatist error. But it was in the
beginning as it is in our own day, a man&rsquo;s doctrinal
aberrations were forgotten, at least for the moment, if
he could write good hymns. So Dionysius, Bishop of
Alexandria, writing against Nepos, &lsquo;a bishop in Egypt,&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_48">48</span>
protests that he &lsquo;greatly loves&rsquo; Nepos for his skill in
psalmody, &lsquo;by which many are still delighted.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_47" href="#fn_47">[47]</a></p>
<p>In an often quoted passage in the <i>Confessions</i>, St.
Augustine tells how he was affected to tears by the
singing of &lsquo;hymns and canticles,&rsquo; and records the
introduction at Milan of antiphonal singing &lsquo;according
to the custom of the Eastern regions,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_48" href="#fn_48">[48]</a> whilst the people
watched in the church ready, if need were, to die with
their beloved bishop, St. Ambrose.</p>
<p>Ambrose of Milan and Hilary of Poictiers divide the
glory of introducing the singing of hymns into the
Church of the West. Hilary compiled a hymn-book&mdash;<i>Liber
Hymnorum</i>&mdash;which is only known to us by a
few hymns more or less doubtfully ascribed to him.
Ambrose is the first great Latin hymn-writer who still
lives in the songs of the sanctuary. His hymns are
unrhymed, and, as Trench says, of &lsquo;almost austere
simplicity.&rsquo;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is as though, building an altar to the living God, he
would observe the Levitical precept, and rear it of unhewn
stones, upon which no tool had been lifted. The great
objects of faith in their simplest expression are felt by him
so sufficient to stir all the deepest affections of the heart,
that any attempt to dress them up, to array them in moving
language, were merely superfluous. The passion is there,
but it is latent and represt, a fire burning inwardly, the
glow of an austere enthusiasm, which reveals itself indeed,
but not to every careless beholder. Nor do we presently fail
to observe how truly these poems belonged to their time
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
and to the circumstances under which they were produced&mdash;how
suitably the faith which was in actual conflict with
and was just triumphing over, the powers of this world,
found its utterance in hymns such as these, wherein is no
softness, perhaps little tenderness; but a rock-like firmness,
the old Roman stoicism transmuted and glorified into that
nobler Christian courage, which encountered and at length
overcame the world.<a class="fn" id="fr_49" href="#fn_49">[49]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>To St. Ambrose many of the earlier Latin hymns
are attributed, and the &lsquo;Te Deum&rsquo; is known in the
Breviaries as &lsquo;The Song of St. Ambrose and St. Austin,&rsquo;
according to the tradition that it was composed and
sung by them in alternate verses when the latter was
baptized at Milan.</p>
<p>The familiar English translation is by an unknown
hand. Grand as it is, there are some verses in which a
more literal rendering would have been still grander.
As the Latin text may not be known by some readers,
I give what may be called the received text&mdash;</p>

<p>In the Prayer-book version we miss the apostles&rsquo;
&lsquo;glorious choir,&rsquo; the martyrs&rsquo; &lsquo;white-robed&rsquo; army; and

as well as more literal had the last lines read&mdash;</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>In the primitive days, before the rise of the medi&aelig;val
Papacy, before the time of Breviary and Mass-book, the
singing of hymns was well established alike in the East
and West. In almost every language in which the
gospel was preached, hymns were written, and were
used not only to aid the devotion of the devout
worshipper in the services of the Church, but to arrest
and teach the careless wayfarer. Thus Bishop Aldhelm
of Sherborne &lsquo;would sit on the bridge, as the people
came out from Mass to loiter gossiping on their
way home, and sing them sacred lays, teaching them
their faith, as it were, in chance verses, and enlisting
in God&rsquo;s service the national love of music and
song. It was Alfred, himself a singer, who preserved
this tale.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_52" href="#fn_52">[52]</a></p>
<p>In later days, when the Romish worship had become
more elaborate and formal, it is chiefly in the Breviaries
that we find the hymns of the Church, in Latin, of
course, and as little understanded of the people as the
rest of the service. A large number of these hymns are
in existence, and whilst many are disfigured by the
idolatrous and often coarse adoration offered to the
Virgin Mary and the saints, and others dwell with
dreadful particularity upon the details of the Passion,
many give worthy and sincere expression to the
profoundest experiences of the devout soul. Some of
the best and sweetest of these songs, which are often
reckoned amongst &lsquo;ancient&rsquo; hymns, belong to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
degenerate days of the Papacy. They are not only
intrinsically precious, but are gracious evidence that
the genuine spirit of devotion was found, and the voice
of praise and prayer and penitence heard, in quiet
places and pure hearts, even in a time of general
apostasy. Any detailed reference to pre-Reformation
hymns would be outside the limits of this lecture, but
the translations of Greek and Latin hymns which are
to be found in our modern hymnals will naturally
claim attention at a later stage.</p>
<p>In concluding this brief and necessarily superficial
preliminary sketch, I may refer to a few of the ancient
hymns which are probably little known to the ordinary
worshipper.</p>
<p>1. <i>Syriac.</i>&mdash;These are chiefly known to us through
the great teacher and writer, Ephraem Syrus, who died
at Edessa in 373. His hymns were written to counteract
the influence of the popular songs of the heretic
Bardesanes, and his son Harmonius. Dr. Bonar, Mrs.
Charles, Mr. Moorsom, and others have translated several
of these Syriac hymns; but they are not likely ever to
win such wide acceptance as the Latin or the Greek
hymns, though a few are to be found in modern collections.
Several of the most touching of St. Ephraem&rsquo;s
hymns are on the death of children, whilst others
celebrate the hosannas of the children at the Triumphal
Entry. I give a translation, or &lsquo;imitation,&rsquo; by Dr.
Bonar of a hymn for the Lord&rsquo;s Day.</p>

<p>2. <i>Greek.</i>&mdash;What is often called the first Christian
hymn is found in the <i>Paedagogus</i>, or <i>Tutor</i>, of St.
Clement of Alexandria (d. <i>cir.</i> 212). It has been
translated into English by many writers. Dean
Plumptre&rsquo;s version is the best known. At the end
of his treatise Clement &lsquo;burst out into a kind of choral,
dithyrambic ode, in anap&aelig;stic metre, the lines very short
and abrupt, and the whole being more exclamatory and
fervid than most later hymns.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I must add one other hymn, though it has been
often translated, and is found in several modern hymn-books.
There is a pretty little version in Longfellow&rsquo;s
<i>Golden Legend</i>, but the best is Keble&rsquo;s fine rendering
published in the <i>Lyra Apostolica</i>. It is a hymn for
eventide, and was sung at &lsquo;The Lighting of the Lamps.&rsquo;
It has been sung at vespers in the Greek Church for
many centuries, and is still in daily use.</p>

<p>3. <i>Latin.</i>&mdash;The following hymn has not only intrinsic
value, but peculiar interest on account of St.
Augustine&rsquo;s reference to it as having brought to his
eyes the kindly relief of tears, as he thought of his
mother laid that day in her grave.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Then I slept and rose up again, and found my sorrow
diminished not a little and as I lay lonely on my bed I
recalled the truthful verses of Thy Ambrose ... and I gave
my tears, which I had restrained till now, leave to flow as
they would.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is found in the Breviaries as a Saturday vesper
hymn, and is a good example of the hymns of St.
Ambrose. It has much of the strength and simplicity
of Ken&rsquo;s hymns.</p>

<p>I would gladly linger awhile longer among these
ancient hymns; but except as they have passed into our
hymnals in the last two centuries, they hardly belong

<br />Early Modern Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c5">I.&mdash;<span class="sc">Sixteenth Century</span></h3>
<p>Before the Reformation England was rich in
ballads, but had practically no hymns. Yet
there are in that earlier period a few great
names&mdash;C&aelig;dmon, Aldhelm, Bede, Alfred&mdash;which are
beginning to appear in some modern hymnals.<a class="fn" id="fr_56" href="#fn_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>It is usual to date English hymnody from the
days of Dr. Watts. Before his time, however, a
considerable number of hymns had been written in
English, a fair proportion of which were of high poetic
character, and not unsuitable for public worship. But
the idea of a hymn-book had hardly entered the mind
of the Church. Many longed for &lsquo;godly ballads&rsquo; to
supplant the vain songs of the Court, the camp, and the
street, but for the most part they longed in vain. We
must not, however, overlook the preparation made
during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p>The English Reformation had no poet, no one who
could give the common people songs such as Luther
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
had provided for the Germans. Myles Coverdale
(1487-1569), Bishop of Exeter, saw how great the
need was; but he could not supply it, though he
did his best. His &lsquo;Ghostly Psalms and Spiritual
Songs, drawn out of the Holy Scripture for the
comfort and consolation of such as love to rejoice in
God and His Word,&rsquo; is an unsuccessful attempt to
render into English some of the German hymns. He
confesses that the verses are &lsquo;rude in song and rhyme.&rsquo;
Yet there is not wanting that yearning after God, that
quiet trust in Christ, that turning to Him with hope
and penitence and love which is the note of all
Christian psalmody. I quote a few verses&mdash;modernizing
the spelling&mdash;from what is, I think, his best
effort.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I call on Thee, Lord Jesu Christ,</p>
<p class="t0">I have none other help but Thee:</p>
<p class="t0">My heart is never set at rest,</p>
<p class="t0">Till Thy sweet word have comforted me.</p>
<p class="t0">And steadfast faith grant me therefore,</p>
<p class="t0">To hold by Thy word evermore.</p>
<p class="t2">Above all thing</p>
<p class="t2">Never resisting</p>
<p class="t0">But to increase in faith more and more.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, print into my heart and mind</p>
<p class="t0">Thy Holy Spirit with ferventness;</p>
<p class="t0">That I to Thee be not unkind,</p>
<p class="t0">But love Thee without feignedness.</p>
<p class="t0">Let nothing draw my mind from Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">But ever to love Thee earnestly:</p>
<p class="t2">Let not my heart</p>
<p class="t2">Unthankfully depart</p>
<p class="t0">From the right love of Thy mercy.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Give me Thy grace, Lord, I Thee pray,</p>
<p class="t0">To love mine enemies heartily:</p>
<p class="t0">Howbeit they trouble me alway,</p>
<p class="t0">And for Thy cause do slander me,</p>
<p class="t0">Yet, Jesu Christ, for Thy goodness,</p>
<p class="t0">Fill my heart with forgiveness,</p>
<p class="t2">That while I live</p>
<p class="t2">I may them forgive</p>
<p class="t0">That do offend me more or less.<a class="fn" id="fr_57" href="#fn_57">[57]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Coverdale&rsquo;s hymns prepared the way for more
successful efforts in the same direction. And it is
pleasant to remember that the brave old reformer, who
stood by his friend and tutor, Robert Barnes, the
martyr, when he was summoned to appear before
Wolsey as a heretic, and who devoted so many years
to the translation of the Holy Scriptures, was one of
the first who desired to make the English folk love
godly hymns.</p>
<p>It is an ancient fashion to disparage Sternhold and
Hopkins&rsquo;s version of the Psalms, but it was a great
advance upon Coverdale, and &lsquo;marks an era in the
history of sacred song.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_58" href="#fn_58">[58]</a> Sternhold died in 1549,
and Coverdale survived him for twenty years. He
was Groom of the Robes to both Henry VIII and
Edward VI. Probably the popularity of Clement
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
Marot&rsquo;s<a class="fn" id="fr_59" href="#fn_59">[59]</a> French version may have suggested to Sternhold
the attempt to provide the English Court with
similar sacred songs instead of the profane ballads
which pleased both French and English courtiers.
Henry had a sincere regard for him, and remembered
him in his will. Edward loved to hear these metrical
psalms sung by their author, and caused them to be
&lsquo;sung openly,&rsquo; so that others might learn to love them
as he did. Sternhold was a modest man, and did not
claim any great merit for his songs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Albeit,&rsquo; he says, in his dedication to Edward VI, &lsquo;I cannot
give to your Majesty great loaves, or bring into the
Lord&rsquo;s barn full handfuls ... I am bold to present unto
your Majesty a few crumbs which I have picked up from
under the Lord&rsquo;s board.&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Part of his version of Ps. xviii. is usually given as the
best example of his work.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O God, my strength and fortitude,</p>
<p class="t">Of force I must love Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>There are some good verses in Ps. ix., which are of the
same type.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Lord, with all my heart and mind</p>
<p class="t">I will give thanks to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">And speak of all Thy wondrous works</p>
<p class="t">Unsearchable of me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I will be glad and much rejoice</p>
<p class="t">In Thee, O God, most high;</p>
<p class="t0">And make my songs extol Thy name</p>
<p class="t">Above the starry sky.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For evermore in dignity</p>
<p class="t">The Lord doth rule and reign;</p>
<p class="t0">And in the seat of equity</p>
<p class="t">True judgement doth maintain.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With justice He doth keep and guide</p>
<p class="t">The world and every wight,</p>
<p class="t0">With conscience and with equity</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He is Protector of the poor,</p>
<p class="t">What time they be opprest;</p>
<p class="t0">He is in all adversity</p>
<p class="t">Their refuge and their rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All they that know Thy holy name,</p>
<p class="t">Therefore do trust in Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">For Thou forsakest not their suit,</p>
<p class="t">In their necessity.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But sure the Lord will not forget</p>

</div>
<p>The Old Version, which bears the name of Sternhold
and Hopkins, was the work of several hands.
<span class="pb" id="Page_67">67</span>
John Hopkins was the largest contributor. Of his
life little is known. Warton called him not the least
of the British poets of his day, and his versions are
generally considered superior to Sternhold&rsquo;s. They
are no doubt smoother, but I cannot see that they have
more poetry in them. Sometimes his lines are ridiculously
divided, and it is difficult to imagine that at any
period they could have been regarded as tolerable.</p>
<p>It was, however, a psalm of Hopkins&rsquo;s which comforted
John Wesley after hearing a sermon, of which
he disapproved, at Bow, in 1738. &lsquo;God answered the
thoughts of my heart, and took away my fear, in a
manner I did not expect, even by the words of Thomas
Sternhold. They were these (sung immediately after
the sermon)&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy mercy is above all things,</p>
<p class="t">O God; it doth excel;</p>
<p class="t0">In trust whereof, as in Thy wings,</p>
<p class="t">The sons of men shall dwell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Within Thy house they shall be fed</p>
<p class="t">With plenty at their will;</p>
<p class="t0">Of all delights they shall be sped,</p>
<p class="t">And take thereof their fill.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Because the well of life most pure,</p>
<p class="t">Doth ever flow from Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">And in Thy light we are most sure,</p>
<p class="t">Eternal light to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">From such as Thee desire to know,</p>
<p class="t">Let not Thy grace depart;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy righteousness declare and show</p>
<p class="t">To men of upright heart.</p>

<p>William Whittingham, Calvin&rsquo;s brother-in-law, and
Knox&rsquo;s successor as pastor of the English congregation
at Geneva, contributed about twelve psalms, including
the cxix., which runs to over 700 lines. In 1563
he became Dean of Durham, and was excommunicated
by the Archbishop of York (father of George
Sandys). He died in 1579, and was buried in the
cathedral in which he is said to have destroyed the
image of St. Cuthbert and other ancient monuments
which were obnoxious to his Puritan taste. Other
writers were John Pullain, another Genevan exile;
Robert Wisdome, who was frightened into a recantation
of his &lsquo;errors&rsquo; by Bishop Bonner, but shortly after
recanted again; Thomas Norton, who wrote the version
of Ps. cxlvii., beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Praise ye the Lord, for it is good</p>

<p class="t">It is a comely thing.</p>

<p>William Kethe, author of &lsquo;All people that on earth
do dwell;&rsquo; John Marckant, and John Craig.<a class="fn" id="fr_60" href="#fn_60">[60]</a> John
Marckant, vicar in 1559 of Great Clacton, and of
Shopland 1563-8, was the author of four psalms
in the Old Version. But he is remembered by &lsquo;The
Lamentation of a Sinner,&rsquo; which is one of the redeeming
features of the book. It is known in modern times
almost exclusively in Heber&rsquo;s revision. The original is
admirable in its pathos and simplicity.</p>

<h4>THE LAMENTATION OF A SINNER</h4>

<p class="t">Before Thy mercy-gate.</p>
<p class="t0">Which gate Thou openest wide to those</p>
<p class="t">That do lament their sin,</p>
<p class="t0">Shut not that gate against me, Lord,</p>
<p class="t">But let me enter in.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And call me not to mine account,</p>
<p class="t">How I have liv&egrave;d here;</p>
<p class="t0">For then I know right well, O Lord,</p>
<p class="t">How vile I shall appear.</p>
<p class="t0">I need not to confess my life,</p>
<p class="t">I am sure Thou canst tell,</p>
<p class="t0">What I have been, and what I am,</p>
<p class="t">I know Thou knowest it well.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Lord, Thou knowest what things be past,</p>
<p class="t">And eke the things that be;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou knowest also what is to come,</p>
<p class="t">Nothing is hid from Thee.</p>
<p class="t0">Before the heavens and earth were made,</p>

<p class="t0">As all things else that have been since</p>
<p class="t">Among the sons of men.</p>

<p class="t0">And can the things that I have done,</p>
<p class="t">Be hidden from Thee then?</p>
<p class="t0">Nay, nay, Thou knowest them all, O Lord,</p>
<p class="t">Where they were done and when.</p>
<p class="t0">Wherefore with tears I come to Thee,</p>
<p class="t">To beg and to entreat,</p>

<p class="t0">So come I to Thy mercy-gate,</p>

<p class="t0">O Lord, I need not to repeat,</p>
<p class="t">What I do beg or crave:</p>

<p class="t">The thing that I would have.</p>

<p>With Sternhold and Hopkins began the reign of
the metrical Psalter. The attempt to turn the whole
book of Psalms into verse for congregational use
has had a curious fascination. No one has attained
more than very partial success, not even Watts or
Keble. In Julian&rsquo;s long list of those who have
essayed to render the Psalms into English verse, are
many names upon which one lingers with interest.
Queen Elizabeth, Sir Thomas Wyatt, Archbishop
Parker, Sir Philip Sidney and his sister, the Countess
of Pembroke, Bishop Hall, George Wither, George
Herbert, George Sandys, John Milton, General Fairfax,
Richard Baxter, Joseph Addison, Cotton Mather,
Christopher Smart, and great numbers in more recent
times.</p>
<p>Of the multitude of these forgotten psalms the
majority, even of the best, are but literary curiosities,
myriads are not even curious, they are simply dull. A
few little-known psalms of these early days I quote
<span class="pb" id="Page_71">71</span>
either for their own or their authors&rsquo; sake. The
following by Queen Elizabeth is characteristically
vigorous in expression. I have modernized the
spelling&mdash;</p>
<h4>PSALM XIV</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fools, that true faith yet never had,</p>
<p class="t0">Say in their hearts there is no God!</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">From heaven the Lord on man did look</p>

<p>In the sandy desert of the metrical Psalters there
are, however, some wells of living water. Such are
the psalms of Sir Philip Sidney and his sister, and
those of George Sandys. The metre, for the most
part, as well as the language, makes them unsuitable
for use in the congregation; but I think many readers
will be glad to see the following verses. The verses
from Ps. xix. are by Sir Philip, and the version of
Ps. xciii. is by the Countess of Pembroke.</p>
<h4>PSALM XIX</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The heavenly frame sets forth the fame</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Day unto day doth it display,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There is no speech, nor language, which</p>

<h4>PSALM XCIII</h4>

<p>George Sandys (1577-1643) was a true poet. Dryden
called him &lsquo;the best versifier of the former age,&rsquo; and
Richard Baxter said, &lsquo;I must confess after all that,
next the Scripture poems, there are none so savoury
to me as Mr. George Herbert&rsquo;s and Mr. George Sandys&rsquo;s.&rsquo;
Charles the First comforted himself with Sandys&rsquo;s
psalms during his imprisonment at Carisbrooke.</p>
<p>He is even yet little known to our hymn-books,
though a few of his psalms make, with a little adaptation,
good hymns. The <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i> contains two&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou who art enthroned above<a class="fn" id="fr_64" href="#fn_64">[64]</a> (Ps. xcii.).</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ye who dwell above the skies (Ps. cxlviii.).</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>His version of Ps. lxvi. also has some good lines. It
begins&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Happy sons of Israel,</p>
<p class="t0">Who in pleasant Canaan dwell:</p>
<p class="t0">Fill the air with shouts of joy,</p>
<p class="t0">Shouts redoubled from the sky.</p>
<p class="t0">Sing the great Jehovah&rsquo;s praise,</p>
<p class="t0">Trophies to His glory raise.</p>
</div>
<p>These quotations must suffice for the psalms of the
period between the Old and New Versions. Those
who are interested in this not very attractive literature
will find specimens of the principal British and
American writers in Holland&rsquo;s <i>Psalmists of Britain</i>
(1843), and Glass&rsquo;s <i>Story of the Psalters</i> (1888). When
one looks at the two authorized metrical versions, and
the many attempts made to supplant them, it is difficult
to understand how the Church could so long have clung
to the metrical Psalter, and could be so slow to use
a hymn-book. Keble says of his own version&mdash;&lsquo;It was
undertaken, in the first instance, with a serious apprehension,
which has since grown into a full conviction,
that the thing attempted is, strictly speaking, <i>impossible</i>.&rsquo;
Yet scores have made the same fruitless effort since
Keble failed.</p>
<p>Apart from the psalm-versions there are few hymns
of the sixteenth century. George Gascoigne (d. 1577),
a lawyer, poet, and courtier of Elizabeth&rsquo;s day, and
a descendant of Sir William Gascoigne, the judge who
committed Henry V, when Prince of Wales, to prison,
wrote a poem entitled &lsquo;Good Morrow,&rsquo; from which
<span class="pb" id="Page_75">75</span>
a good hymn has been made, which is in many of the
better school hymnals.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">You that have spent the silent night</p>
<p class="t">In sleep and quiet rest,</p>

<p class="t0">Now clear your voice, now cheer your heart,</p>

<p>Thomas Campion (1567-1619), a doctor of
medicine, wrote some lovely hymns, &lsquo;admirable for
their union of melodious simplicity, beauty, and strong
common sense.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_66" href="#fn_66">[66]</a> Josiah Conder included one in the
section for Private Worship of the Congregational
hymn-book, 1836.<a class="fn" id="fr_67" href="#fn_67">[67]</a></p>
<div class="verse">

<p class="t0">O come quickly, glorious Lord, and raise my sprite to Thee!</p>
</div>
<p>Here is another of Campion&rsquo;s hymns.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">View me, Lord, a work of Thine!</p>
<p class="t">Shall I then lie drowned in night?</p>

</div>
<p>Campion is not mentioned in the <i>Dictionary of
Hymnology</i>, but he deserves a place there.</p>
<p>One other hymn must be mentioned, &lsquo;Jerusalem,
my happy home.&rsquo; It is found in a MS. preserved in
the British Museum, with the title &lsquo;A Song Mad, by
F. B. P. To the tune of Diana.&rsquo; Who the author was no
one knows, but internal evidence indicates that he was
a devout Roman Catholic. In the <i>Arundel Hymns</i>
it is attributed to Father Laurence Anderton, <i>alias</i>
John Beverley, S.J. The MS. has twenty-six verses,
of which nineteen were printed in London in 1601.
The hymn is probably based upon a passage in the
<i>Meditations of St. Augustine</i>. The popular modern
hymn, &lsquo;Jerusalem, my happy home,&rsquo; which is now
believed to have been written by Joseph Bromehead,
Vicar of Eckington, near Sheffield, was no doubt
suggested by this hymn, or one of the various versions
of it, but has little verbal agreement except in the
first and last verses. I give a portion of the original
poem.</p>

<br />Early Modern Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c6">II.&mdash;<span class="sc">Seventeenth Century</span></h3>
<p>When the seventeenth century opened there
were, as we have seen, hardly any English
hymns except such as may be taken from
metrical versions of the Psalms. With the new
century a new era begins; and though we are not yet
in what George Macdonald calls &lsquo;the zone of hymn-writing,&rsquo;
we are soon able to gather the materials
of a hymn-book of the modern type. It would be
quite possible to compile a very good hymnal from
writers who preceded Dr. Watts, if a wise editorial
discretion were exercised in the omission of unsuitable
verses and the revision of phrases offensive to modern
taste.</p>
<p>Amongst the hymn-writers of the seventeenth
century one name is pre-eminent&mdash;Thomas Ken (1637-1711),
Bishop of Bath and Wells. His fame rests upon
his three great hymns&mdash;Morning, Evening, and Midnight&mdash;for
little else in his voluminous poetical works
is suited to the worship of the sanctuary. In all the
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
Christian choir there is no worthier name than that of
Thomas Ken, whom neither fear nor flattery could
move from the strait path of duty. He lived in the
spirit of his own lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let all thy converse be sincere,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy conscience as the noonday clear;</p>
<p class="t0">Think how all-seeing God thy ways,</p>
<p class="t0">And all thy secret thoughts surveys.</p>
</div>
<p>He spent his earlier years of ministry in quiet places,
amongst those who honoured and loved him, but later
had some curious experiences as Lord Dartmouth&rsquo;s
chaplain at Tangier, where he testified with his accustomed
resolution against evil-doers and evil-speakers,
coming, as Samuel Pepys records, into collision with
the afterwards infamous Colonel Kirke, because he
preached against &lsquo;the excessive liberty of swearing
which we observe here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Amongst all the heroes of his day there was none
with a more serene courage than &lsquo;little Ken,&rsquo; who
would not receive Charles&rsquo;s mistress at his house&mdash;&lsquo;No,
not for his kingdom&rsquo;&mdash;and thus won his bishopric in
as unlikely and as creditable a fashion as ever bishopric
was earned. After that one is not surprised to find
him, as one of the seven bishops, saying to James II,
&lsquo;We have two duties to perform, our duty to God and
our duty to your Majesty. We honour you, but we
fear God.&rsquo; Nor need we wonder that, notwithstanding
his resistance of James&rsquo;s illegal demands, he could not
bring himself to take the oath of allegiance to William
<span class="pb" id="Page_82">82</span>
of Orange. Ken always had that infirmity of noble
souls, &lsquo;a weakness for the weaker side.&rsquo; As Dean
Plumptre well says, &lsquo;If he was in doubt it was safer,
in quite another sense than that in which others
counted safety, to take the losing and not the winning
side.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Ken was deprived in 1791, and the bishopric was
offered to Beveridge, then Archdeacon of Colchestor.
Had Ken been translated to heaven, or to Canterbury,
Beveridge would have accepted the preferment with
delight, for he had no nonjuring scruples and wished
to be a bishop. But he too was a saint, and not
unworthy to be Ken&rsquo;s successor; so he would not take
the place from which Ken had been thrust out, and
waited thirteen years for &lsquo;preferment,&rsquo; becoming Bishop
of St. Asaph in 1704.</p>
<p>When Ken left the episcopal palace, Lord Weymouth
honoured his own magnificent mansion of Longleat by
welcoming Ken to its hospitable shelter, as Sir Thomas
Abney, in widely different circumstances, made the
great Nonconformist hymn-writer his guest twenty-five
years later. Longleat was Ken&rsquo;s home for twenty
years. There he died, after long and acute suffering,
soothed by the writing of hymns, and by the thought
that they would be sung on earth while he praised God
in heaven.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twill heighten even the joys of heaven to know</p>
<p class="t0">That in my verse the saints hymn God below.<a class="fn" id="fr_69" href="#fn_69">[69]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>Ken&rsquo;s hymns, as we now sing them, are selected from
the thirty-seven verses of the originals, which were
intended in the first place for the scholars of his old
school&mdash;Winchester. As in most other cases, the popular
selection is amply justified. The hymns abbreviated
are much more serviceable alike for public and
private devotion than if they were transferred <i>in extenso</i>
to our hymn-books. Like Sternhold, Herbert, and
Watts, Ken was a musician, and loved to accompany
himself on the lute or organ.</p>
<p>The morning hymn, which consists of fourteen
verses, falls into three sections, addressed (1) to the
soul, (2) to the angels, (3) to God. In the evening
hymn two verses are addressed to the guardian angel.
The following verses from the morning hymn are not
usually found in modern hymnals&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Influenced by the Light Divine,</p>
<p class="t0">Let thy own light in good works shine:</p>
<p class="t0">Reflect all Heaven&rsquo;s propitious ways,</p>
<p class="t0">In ardent love, and cheerful praise.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Awake, awake,<a class="fn" id="fr_70" href="#fn_70">[70]</a> ye heavenly choir,</p>
<p class="t0">May your devotion me inspire,</p>
<p class="t0">That I, like you, my age may spend,</p>
<p class="t0">Like you, may on my God attend.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">May I, like you, in God delight,</p>
<p class="t0">Have all day long my God in sight,</p>
<p class="t0">Perform, like you, my Maker&rsquo;s will;</p>
<p class="t0">O may I never more do ill!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Had I your wings, to heaven I&rsquo;d fly,</p>
<p class="t0">But God shall that defect supply,</p>
<p class="t0">And my soul winged with warm desire,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall all day long to heaven aspire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I would not wake, nor rise again,</p>
<p class="t0">Even heaven itself I would disdain;</p>
<p class="t0">Wert not Thou there to be enjoyed,</p>
<p class="t0">And I in hymns to be employed.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Heaven is, dear Lord, where&rsquo;er Thou art,</p>
<p class="t0">O never then from me depart;</p>
<p class="t0">For to my soul &rsquo;tis hell to be</p>
<p class="t0">But for one moment without<a class="fn" id="fr_71" href="#fn_71">[71]</a> Thee.</p>
</div>
<p>The special charm of Ken&rsquo;s hymns lies in their
simplicity and suitability. In the plainest words he
asks for just what every Christian feels that he needs,
morning and evening, his whole life through. They are
the first great English hymns, and are worthy to lead
the devotions of the Church.</p>
<p>Ken&rsquo;s influence upon later poets has been great.
Charles Wesley, Keble, and Christopher Wordsworth
were, to some extent, inspired by his hymns on the
Festivals, whilst Newman desired to add Ken to the
Calendar of English saints, and actually prepared a
service for use on &lsquo;Ken&rsquo;s day.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_72" href="#fn_72">[72]</a></p>
<p>Archbishop Alexander, himself a poet, preaching in
Wells Cathedral at the festival commemorative of the
bicentenary of Ken&rsquo;s consecration, said&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>Outside the Psalter, no lines have ever been so familiar
to English Christians as Ken&rsquo;s Morning and Evening Hymn.
Other hymns have been more mystical, more impassioned,
more imaginative&mdash;have perhaps contained profounder
thoughts in their depth, have certainly exhibited richer
colouring upon their surface. But none are so suitable to
the homely pathos and majesty of the English Liturgy;
none are so adapted to the character which the English
Church has aimed at forming, the sweet reserve, the quiet
thoroughness, the penitence which is continuous without
being unhopeful. They are lines which the child may
repeat without the painful sense that they are beyond him,
and the man without the contemptuous sense that they are
below him. They appeal to the man in the child, and the
child in the man. They are at once a form of devotion, a
rule of life, a breath of prayer, a sigh of aspiration. They
are the utterances of a heart which had no contempt for
earth, but which is at home among the angels. When we
listen to them, or repeat them with congenial spirit, in
whatever climate we may be, the roses of the English dawn
and the gold of the English sunset are in our sky.<a class="fn" id="fr_73" href="#fn_73">[73]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Montgomery wrote of Ken&rsquo;s three hymns that, &lsquo;had
he endowed three hospitals, he might have been less
a benefactor to posterity.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_74" href="#fn_74">[74]</a> The importance of his
hymns as setting a standard of simplicity and directness
can hardly be overstated. Yet it is curious how slowly
they won general acceptance. They were not printed
in the supplement to the Book of Common Prayer
till 1801, and though John Wesley included them in
his <i>Psalms and Hymns</i>, 1738, he omitted them from
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
his later publications and from his hymn-book. Dean
Plumptre, however, says that both the hymns had
appeared in some of the earlier collections of hymns
for congregational use by English clergymen between
1750 and 1760. The three hymns are given in the
<i>Moravian Hymn-book</i> of 1754.</p>
<p>After Ken the seventeenth century had no sweeter
hymn-writer than John Austin (1613-69), who left
St. John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, in 1640, on becoming
a Romanist. He wrote two volumes of <i>Devotions in
the Ancient Way of Offices</i>. These were &lsquo;a family
piece among Catholics,&rsquo; and were much used by devout
Protestants. The nonjuring Bishop Hickes edited them
for Protestant use, and John Wesley included seven of
the hymns in his Charlestown hymn-book&mdash;a larger
number than by any other author except Watts.
Austin did not complete his work. &lsquo;Death, for which
he had fitted his soul by a well-spent life, interrupted
his labours.... When he perceived death immediately
seizing its prey, he gave up the ghost with these
remarkable words: ... &ldquo;Now, heartily for heaven,
through Jesus Christ!&rdquo;&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_75" href="#fn_75">[75]</a></p>
<p>Austin&rsquo;s hymns are used chiefly outside his own
communion,<a class="fn" id="fr_76" href="#fn_76">[76]</a> though Romanism has no English hymn-writer
to compare with him till the time of Faber.
In the <i>Arundel Hymns</i> his verses are attributed to W.
Austin (a Protestant contemporary). The following
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
hymn illustrates the similarity of Austin and Faber&rsquo;s
writing. Few readers would guess that one of these
four verses was written two centuries after the others.</p>
<h4>FROM DEATH TO LIFE</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesu! all hail. Who for my sin</p>
<p class="t0">Didst die, and by that death didst win</p>
<p class="t2">Eternal life for me;</p>
<p class="t0">Send me Thy grace, good Lord! that I</p>
<p class="t0">Unto the world and flesh may die,</p>
<p class="t2">And hide my life with Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesu! who on that fatal wood</p>
<p class="t0">Poured forth Thy life&rsquo;s last drop of blood,</p>
<p class="t2">Nailed to a shameful cross;</p>
<p class="t0">O may we bless Thy love, and be</p>
<p class="t0">Ready, dear Lord, to bear for Thee</p>
<p class="t2">All grief, all pain, all loss.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesu! who by Thine own love slain,</p>
<p class="t0">By Thine own power took&rsquo;st life again,</p>
<p class="t2">And from the grave didst rise;</p>
<p class="t0">O may Thy death our souls revive,</p>
<p class="t0">And at our death a new life give,</p>
<p class="t2">The life that never dies.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesu! who to Thy heaven again</p>
<p class="t0">Returned in triumph, there to reign</p>
<p class="t2">Of men and angels King;</p>
<p class="t0">O may our parting souls take flight</p>
<p class="t0">Up to that land of joy and light,</p>
<p class="t2">And there for ever sing.<a class="fn" id="fr_77" href="#fn_77">[77]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In this hymn the first verse is from Faber&rsquo;s series
on &lsquo;The Life of our Lord,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_78" href="#fn_78">[78]</a> and the rest from Austin&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
&lsquo;Vespers for our Blessed Saviour.&rsquo; Wesley&rsquo;s selection
from the same hymn began with the verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesu! behold three kings from far,</p>
<p class="t0">Led to Thy cradle by a star,</p>
<p class="t2">Bring gifts to Thee their King:</p>
<p class="t0">O guide us by Thy light, that we</p>
<p class="t0">May find Thy favour and to Thee</p>
<p class="t2">Ourselves for tribute bring.<a class="fn" id="fr_79" href="#fn_79">[79]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Of another hymn which Faber might have written,
I give the first two verses&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sweet Jesu! why, why dost Thou love</p>
<p class="t">Such worthless things as we?</p>
<p class="t0">Why is Thy heart still towards us</p>
<p class="t">Who seldom think on Thee?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy bounty gives us all we have,</p>
<p class="t">And we Thy gifts abuse:</p>
<p class="t0">Thy bounty gives us even Thyself,</p>
<p class="t">And we Thyself refuse.</p>
</div>
<p>Austin&rsquo;s best hymns, however, are, I think, one for
Monday morning, which Wesley entitled &lsquo;Universal
Praise,&rsquo; and the evening hymn, of which some verses
will be familiar to most readers.</p>
<h4>MORNING</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hark, my soul! how every thing</p>

<p>William Austin (d. 1633) had not the devotional
fervour of his younger namesake (he does not seem to
have been a relative, though both were of Lincoln&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_91">91</span>
Inn), but he is among the noteworthy hymn-writers
of a time when hymns were few. As his poems are
little known, I give a charming little hymn and two
verses of a bright Christmas carol&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What a gracious God have we,</p>
<p class="t0">In His gifts of grace how free!</p>
<p class="t0">How intent our prayers to hear,</p>
<p class="t0">And to them that pray how near.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How to balmy mercy prone,</p>
<p class="t0">And to kind compassion.</p>
<p class="t0">How regardfully He wakes,</p>
<p class="t0">For His chosen servants&rsquo; sakes.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How He gives them grace to pray,</p>
<p class="t0">And then to their suits gives way.</p>
<p class="t0">How He prompts each good desire,</p>
<p class="t0">And blows up that spark to fire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He hath set no greater task,</p>
<p class="t0">To obtain of Him but &lsquo;Ask!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">No exacter search to find,</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No more pains heaven to unlock,</p>
<p class="t0">But with spotless hands to knock.</p>

<p>George Wither (1588-1667), lawyer, soldier, poet,
Cavalier, Roundhead, Puritan, Anglican, was a writer
of many hymns. He finds a secluded corner in a few
modern hymnals; but had there been what we call
hymn-books in his day, he would have been a considerable
contributor. His hymns are more of the Evangelical
than the Puritan type. His songs of the Church
form a &lsquo;Christian Year,&rsquo; and some of the hymns for
Saints&rsquo; days are much more original and poetic than
those commonly in use. Here are three verses for&mdash;</p>
<h4>ST. MATTHEW&rsquo;S DAY</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For God doth not a whit respect</p>
<p class="t">Profession, person, or degree;</p>
<p class="t0">But maketh choice of His elect</p>
<p class="t">From every sort of men that be,</p>
<p class="t0">That none might of His love despair,</p>
<p class="t0">But all men unto Him repair.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For those, oh let us therefore pray,</p>
<p class="t">Who seem uncall&egrave;d to remain;</p>
<p class="t0">Not shunning them, as cast away,</p>
<p class="t">God&rsquo;s favour never to obtain:</p>
<p class="t0">For some awhile neglected are,</p>
<p class="t0">To stir in us more loving care.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And for ourselves, let us desire,</p>
<p class="t">That we our avarice may shun;</p>
<p class="t0">When God our service shall require,</p>
<p class="t">As this Evangelist hath done,</p>
<p class="t0">And spend the remnant of our days</p>
<p class="t0">In setting forth our Maker&rsquo;s praise.</p>
</div>
<p>There is nothing in these simple lines of the exquisite
beauty of Keble&rsquo;s poem on St. Matthew&rsquo;s Day, one
verse of which would reconcile the least ecclesiastical
of us to the observance of saints&rsquo; days&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">There are in this loud stunning tide</p>
<p class="t3">Of human care and crime,</p>
<p class="t2">With whom the melodies abide</p>
<p class="t3">Of the everlasting chime;</p>
<p class="t2">Who carry music in their heart,</p>
<p class="t2">Through dusky lane and wrangling mart;</p>
<p class="t">Plying their daily task with busier feet,</p>
<p class="t0">Because their secret souls a holy strain repeat.</p>
</div>
<p>But as a hymn to be sung in church or to be read in
the hour of private devotion, Wither&rsquo;s lines compare
very favourably with those of Bishop Ken,<a class="fn" id="fr_83" href="#fn_83">[83]</a> Bishop
Wordsworth, and even Dr. Monsell.</p>
<p>Wither&rsquo;s hymn for Whit Sunday is a very appropriate
&lsquo;devotion&rsquo; for that festival. Here are four
of its six verses&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Exceeding faithful in Thy word,</p>
<p class="t">And just in all Thy ways,</p>
<p class="t0">We do acknowledge Thee, O Lord,</p>
<p class="t">And therefore give Thee praise:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p class="t0">For as Thy promise Thou didst pass,</p>
<p class="t">Before Thou went&rsquo;st away,</p>
<p class="t0">Sent down Thy Holy Spirit was,</p>
<p class="t">At His appointed day.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now, also, Blessed Spirit, come,</p>
<p class="t">Unto our souls appear;</p>
<p class="t0">And of Thy graces shower Thou some</p>
<p class="t">On this assembly here:</p>
<p class="t0">To us Thy dove-like meekness lend,</p>
<p class="t">That humble we may be,</p>
<p class="t0">And on Thy silver wings ascend,</p>
<p class="t">Our Saviour Christ to see.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let Thy cloven tongues, we pray,</p>
<p class="t">So rest on us again,</p>
<p class="t0">That both the truth confess we may</p>
<p class="t">And teach it other men.</p>
<p class="t0">Moreover, let Thy heavenly fire,</p>
<p class="t">Inflam&egrave;d from above,</p>
<p class="t0">Burn up in us each vain desire,</p>
<p class="t">And warm our hearts with love.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Vouchsafe Thou likewise to bestow</p>
<p class="t">On us Thy sacred peace;</p>
<p class="t0">We stronger may in union grow,</p>
<p class="t">And in debates decrease;</p>
<p class="t0">Which peace, though many yet contemn,</p>
<p class="t">Reform&egrave;d let them be;</p>
<p class="t0">That we may, Lord, have part in them,</p>
<p class="t">And they have part in Thee.</p>
</div>
<p>Other poems in this series are well worth preserving,
though perhaps few would find favour with the average
congregation. For the most part they run smoothly;
the language is that of plain men, and the spirit of the
festival finds happy expression in praise or prayer. His
Communion hymn is intended to be sung during the
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
administration. It is interesting to find that those who
are now adopting this custom are but reviving an ancient
order. &lsquo;We have a custom among us,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;that
during the time of administering the blessed Sacrament
of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper there is some psalm or hymn sung,
the better to keep the thoughts of the communicants
from wandering after vain objects.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But the piece which is most easily adapted to
modern use is the poem, a paraphrase of Ps.
cxlvii., which he prefixed to his <i>Preparation for the
Psalter</i>. I give the poem as Wither published it.
Mr. Horder and Miss Wood<a class="fn" id="fr_84" href="#fn_84">[84]</a> have shown how well it
may be adapted to public worship.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, O come! in pious lays</p>
<p class="t0">Sound we God Almighty&rsquo;s praise;</p>
<p class="t0">Hither bring in one consent,</p>
<p class="t0">Heart, and voice, and instrument.</p>
<p class="t0">Music add of every kind;</p>
<p class="t0">Sound the trump, the cornet wind;</p>
<p class="t0">Strike the viol, touch the lute;</p>
<p class="t0">Let no tongue nor string be mute;</p>
<p class="t">Nor a creature dumb be found,</p>
<p class="t">That hath either voice or sound.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, ye sons of human race,</p>
<p class="t0">In this chorus take a place;</p>
<p class="t0">And amid the mortal throng,</p>
<p class="t0">Be you masters of the song.</p>
<p class="t0">Angels, and supernal powers,</p>
<p class="t0">Be the noblest tenor yours;</p>
<p class="t0">Let in praise of God the sound</p>
<p class="t0">Run a never-ending round;</p>
<p class="t">That our song of praise may be</p>
<p class="t">Everlasting as is He.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">From earth&rsquo;s vast and hollow womb,</p>
<p class="t0">Music&rsquo;s deepest bass may come;</p>
<p class="t0">Seas and floods, from shore to shore,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall their countertenors roar,</p>
<p class="t0">To this concert, when we sing,</p>
<p class="t0">Whistling winds your descants bring;</p>
<p class="t0">That our song may over-climb</p>
<p class="t0">All the bounds of place and time,</p>
<p class="t">And ascend from sphere to sphere,</p>
<p class="t">To the great Almighty&rsquo;s ear.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So, from heaven, on earth He shall</p>
<p class="t0">Let His gracious blessings fall:</p>
<p class="t0">And this huge wide orb we see,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall one choir, one temple be;</p>
<p class="t0">Where, in such a praise-full tone</p>
<p class="t0">We will sing what He hath done,</p>
<p class="t0">That the curs&egrave;d fiends below</p>
<p class="t0">Shall thereat impatient grow.</p>
<p class="t">Then, O come! in pious lays</p>
<p class="t">Sound we God Almighty&rsquo;s praise.</p>
</div>
<p>Wither has been slow in winning his place among
our sacred poets. He was a man of war from his
youth, had a perilous gift of sarcasm, and lacked the
caution and good sense which were so much needed in
his troublous times. He was boycotted by the booksellers,
satirized by Butler in <i>Hudibras</i>, by Pope, Dryden,
and Swift, and seemed likely to be forgotten, save as
the butt of a former age. But Southey, Charles
Lamb, Montgomery, Edward Farr, George Macdonald,
F. T. Palgrave, Dr. Grosart, among others have
recognized his merits. He was a devout man and
courageous, for he not only fought on both sides in the
Civil War, but with rarer bravery chose to remain in
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
London during the Great Plague, and to render what
little help he could to the sufferers in that awful
visitation. The king is said to have spared his life
at Sir John Denham&rsquo;s good-naturedly contemptuous
entreaty that he (Denham) might not be &lsquo;the worst
poet in England&rsquo;; his contemporaries thought the
prison cell a fit cage for the poet, but somehow he
joined the lark, and sang at heaven&rsquo;s gate.<a class="fn" id="fr_85" href="#fn_85">[85]</a></p>
<p>Samuel Crossman, who died in 1683, within a few
weeks of his appointment to the Deanery of Bristol,
makes up in quality what he lacks in quantity. Of
his nine hymns&mdash;published in 1660&mdash;two or three
have won an assured place in the hymn-book of the
Church.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My life&rsquo;s a shade, my days</p>
<p class="t">Apace to death decline.</p>
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sweet place, sweet place alone</p>
<p class="t">The home of God most high.</p>
</div>
<p>They are in a minor key, but they speak to the heart of
the Christian pilgrim who seeks another country&mdash;his
true fatherland. His other hymns are seldom met
with. I quote one, omitting a verse.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<h4>THE GIFT</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc"><span class="small">&lsquo;If thou knewest the gift of God&rsquo; (John iv. 10).</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This is the Gift, Thy Gift, O Lord!</p>
<p class="t">The token of Thy dearest love:</p>
<p class="t0">The orient jewel of Thy Word;</p>
<p class="t">Sent down my thankfulness to prove.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Great is his gift in all men&rsquo;s eyes,</p>
<p class="t">Who gives himself, his friend to save:</p>
<p class="t0">My Lord does more, for foes He dies,</p>
<p class="t">This Gift no parallel may have.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But Lord! whil&rsquo;st Thou thus gav&rsquo;st to Thine</p>
<p class="t">Others arose to vie with Thee:</p>
<p class="t0">The world and Satan did combine,</p>
<p class="t">And they would needs a giving be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Satan, sin&rsquo;s pleasures offer&egrave;d,</p>
<p class="t">And almost forced them upon me:</p>
<p class="t0">But while they bloomed, they wither&egrave;d,</p>
<p class="t">And Lord! Thy Gift my choice shall be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Then did the World its gayes present,</p>
<p class="t">And still alluring cried, See, See!</p>
<p class="t0">Here&rsquo;s that may rather give content;</p>
<p class="t">But Lord! Thy Gift my choice shall be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">These cannot give, they&rsquo;d steal away</p>
<p class="t">From me my heaven, my heart from Thee:</p>

<p class="t">Still Lord! Thy Gift my choice shall be.</p>

<p>Richard Baxter (1615-91) is to Nonconformity
what Ken is to Anglicanism. He might have been
a bishop if he would, but preferred the rough ways of
persecution for conscience&rsquo; sake to the pleasant paths
<span class="pb" id="Page_99">99</span>
of ecclesiastical preferment. He wrote many hymns,
and attempted, with as little success as others, a metrical
version of the psalms. He is, and will be, known to
our hymn-books by the exquisite verses taken from his
long poem on the &lsquo;Covenant and Confidence of Faith.&rsquo;
These verses, beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now it belongs not to my care</p>
<p class="t">Whether I die or live.</p>
</div>
<p>are in almost every hymn-book. Another of his hymns,
in a brighter tone, is in many collections&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ye holy angels bright.</p>
</div>
<p>The two following are not so well known. They are
good in themselves, and very characteristic of their
author.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As for my friends, they are not lost:</p>
<p class="t">The several vessels of Thy fleet,</p>
<p class="t0">Though parted now, by tempests tost,</p>
<p class="t">Shall safely in the haven meet.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Still we are centred all in Thee;</p>
<p class="t">Members, though distant, of one Head,</p>
<p class="t0">In the same family we be,</p>
<p class="t">By the same faith and Spirit led.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Before the throne we daily meet,</p>
<p class="t">As joint petitioners to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">In spirit we each other greet,</p>
<p class="t">And shall again each other see.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The heavenly hosts, world without end,</p>
<p class="t">Shall be my company above;</p>
<p class="t0">And Thou, my best, my surest Friend,</p>
<p class="t">Who shall divide me from Thy love?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>The three following verses are in Miss Wood&rsquo;s
<i>Hymns for School Worship</i>&mdash;a very striking selection of
hymns suitable for intelligent young people.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, though Thy Church in this dark world</p>
<p class="t">Do but begin and learn Thy praise,</p>
<p class="t0">Accept both it and us through Christ,</p>
<p class="t">Till it and us Thy glory raise.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here trembling sin resists Thy grace;</p>
<p class="t">Of joy and sorrow we partake:</p>
<p class="t0">Our broken hearts and broken peace</p>
<p class="t">Can none but broken music make.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy ways to us seem often dark,</p>
<p class="t">Thou crossest human wit and will:</p>
<p class="t0">We murmur; but Thou dost Thy work;</p>
<p class="t">That&rsquo;s wise and good, which we thought ill.</p>
</div>
<p>If Austin is the Faber of the seventeenth century,
John Mason (d. 1694), whom Baxter called &lsquo;the
glory of the Church of England,&rsquo; is its Newton.
There is in Mason the same childlike simplicity which
is the charm of the Olney hymns, with an added
quaintness which belongs to the earlier century. He
is one of the minor poets of the sanctuary, but in his
own time he was amongst the best of the evangelical
hymn-writers. Mason was born a Dissenter, but
entered the Anglican Church. His friend, Thomas
Shepherd (1665-1739), who also wrote some noteworthy
hymns, seceded from the Establishment, and was for a
few years pastor of the church at Nottingham, where
Doddridge subsequently ministered. Of the hymns
of these good men, George Macdonald and Mr. Horder
<span class="pb" id="Page_101">101</span>
express a high opinion, comparing them favourably
with those of Dr. Watts. Mr. Horder justly says that
Mason would have reached a higher standard had his
lot been cast in a &lsquo;hymn-singing age.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Some of Mason&rsquo;s verses are too racy for congregational
use, e.g. this from &lsquo;A Song of Praise for
Health&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Their earnest cries do pierce the skies,</p>
<p class="t">And shall I silent be?</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, were I sick as I am well,</p>
<p class="t">Thou shouldst have heard from me.</p>
<p class="t0">The sick have not more cause to pray</p>
<p class="t">Than I to praise my King;</p>
<p class="t0">Since nature teaches them to groan</p>
<p class="t">Let grace teach me to sing.</p>
</div>
<p>Here is a verse from his &lsquo;Song of Praise for the Birth
of Christ&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The wakeful shepherds near their flocks</p>
<p class="t">Were watching for the morn;</p>
<p class="t0">But better news from heaven was brought&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Your Saviour Christ is born.</p>
<p class="t0">In Bethlehem the Infant lies,</p>
<p class="t">Within a place obscure;</p>
<p class="t0">O little Bethlehem, poor in walls</p>
<p class="t">But rich in furniture!</p>
</div>
<p>One of his best hymns, perhaps the very best, is</p>
<h4>A GENERAL SONG OF PRAISE TO ALMIGHTY GOD</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How shall I sing that Majesty</p>
<p class="t">Which angels do admire?</p>

<p>Shepherd&rsquo;s poems were called &lsquo;Penitential Cries,&rsquo;
and were published with Mason&rsquo;s Songs of Praise in
1693. His best-known hymn begins</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Alas, my God, that we should be</p>
<p class="t">Such strangers to each other!</p>
<p class="t0">O that as friends we might agree,</p>

<p>Most of his hymns have vigour and freshness, but
there is generally something which hinders them from
becoming hymns of the first class. The following
verses are taken from a hymn entitled, &lsquo;Lamenting the
Loss of First Love,&rsquo; and were probably known to
Cowper&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O that my soul was now as fair</p>

<p>Other hymn-writers of this period are almost or
entirely unknown to modern hymnals. One or two
names may, however, be mentioned. Matthew Henry
wrote a number of &lsquo;family hymns&rsquo;; Benjamin Keach
(1640-1704) not only wrote hymns by the hundred, but
published a defence of congregational singing under the
title&mdash;<i>The Breach repaired in God&rsquo;s Worship</i>.</p>
<p>William Barton may be taken as a fair example of
the poorer hymn-writers of the time. There is little
to choose between the best and the worst of his <i>Six
Centuries of Hymns</i>. The work was dedicated to Sir
Matthew Hale, who had spoken a good word for the
<span class="pb" id="Page_105">105</span>
hymns to the Mayor and Aldermen of Leicester, in
which town Barton had been minister of St. Martin&rsquo;s
Church. Led by Dr. Julian&rsquo;s statement that these
hymns &lsquo;deserve more attention from compilers than
they have hitherto received,&rsquo; I have searched them
diligently, but in vain. I am most impressed that
such dull productions could ever have been popular.</p>
<p>There is, indeed, something very pathetic in the
author&rsquo;s evident satisfaction with his work and in his
son&rsquo;s pride in his father&rsquo;s &lsquo;pious and laborious undertaking,&rsquo;
which he was led to attempt, &lsquo;finding that the
ancient usage of our speech in Sternhold and Hopkins&rsquo;s
translation was become obsoletely contemptuous to
many people of this age.&rsquo; This filial editor believed
that the hymn-book &lsquo;would sufficiently manifest its
excellency in the perusal,&rsquo; a belief which the extensive
circulation of its many editions may be taken to justify.
Barton&rsquo;s first book, his version of the Psalms, was
published in 1644, and the last edition was printed in
1768. During a great part of that period it was
probably the standard psalter of the Nonconformist
congregations. His hymns are usually brief, and he
was careful to use familiar metres, having a special
weakness for &lsquo;delicate and expeditious tunes.&rsquo; His
psalms and hymns owed their long life to the poverty
of rivals, but one cannot be surprised that Enoch Watts,
in urging his brother &lsquo;to oblige the world by showing
it your hymns in print,&rsquo; should say that &lsquo;honest Barton
chimes us asleep.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>The following verses are a fair specimen&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My Saviour, my Beloved One,</p>
<p class="t">Is mine and I am His;</p>
<p class="t0">Chief of ten thousand He alone,</p>
<p class="t">Pure red and white He is.</p>
<p class="t0">Made sin for us that knew no sin,</p>
<p class="t">That so we might be made</p>
<p class="t0">The righteousness of God in Him,</p>
<p class="t">By whom the price was paid.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Stronger than death His love is found.</p>
<p class="t">Not to be bought with goods:</p>
<p class="t0">Nor quenched with waters, nor be drowned</p>
<p class="t">With whatsoever floods.</p>
<p class="t0">O draw me, my dear Saviour,</p>
<p class="t">With these strong cords of love,</p>
<p class="t0">And then will we go after Thee</p>
<p class="t">As fast as we can move.<a class="fn" id="fr_86" href="#fn_86">[86]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Although the seventeenth century is poor in hymn-writers,
we find some grand and beautiful hymns
written by poets and men of letters. There is, for
instance, Sir Thomas Browne&rsquo;s evening hymn, of
which he says, &lsquo;This is the dormitive I take to bedward:
I need no other <i>laudanum</i> than this to make me
sleep; after which I close mine eyes in security, content
to take my leave of the sun, and sleep unto the
resurrection.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_87" href="#fn_87">[87]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The night is come, like to the day;</p>
<p class="t0">Depart not Thou, great God away.</p>
<p class="t0">Let not my sins, black as the night,</p>
<p class="t0">Eclipse the lustre of Thy light.</p>
<p class="t0">Keep still in my horizon; for to me</p>
<p class="t0">The sun makes not the day, but Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou whose nature cannot sleep,</p>
<p class="t0">On my temples sentry keep;</p>
<p class="t0">Guard me &rsquo;gainst those watchful foes,</p>
<p class="t0">Whose eyes are open while mine close.</p>
<p class="t0">Let no dreams my head infest,</p>
<p class="t0">But such as Jacob&rsquo;s temples blest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">While I do rest, my soul advance:</p>
<p class="t0">Make my sleep a holy trance;</p>
<p class="t0">That I may, my rest being wrought,</p>
<p class="t0">Awake into some holy thought,</p>
<p class="t0">And with as active vigour run</p>
<p class="t0">My course as doth the nimble sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sleep is a death&mdash;O make me try</p>
<p class="t0">By sleeping, what it is to die!</p>
<p class="t0">And as gently lay my head</p>
<p class="t0">On my grave, as now my bed.</p>
<p class="t0">Howe&rsquo;er I rest, great God, let me</p>
<p class="t0">Awake again at last with Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And thus assured, behold I lie</p>
<p class="t0">Securely, or to wake or die.</p>
<p class="t0">These are my drowsy days; in vain</p>
<p class="t0">I do not wake to sleep again:</p>
<p class="t0">O come that hour, when I shall never</p>
<p class="t0">Sleep again, but wake for ever!</p>
</div>
<p>Another great name is that of John Donne, Dean
of St. Paul&rsquo;s, and friend of James I, who wrote one
of the truest and most affecting hymns of that or any
other century. If its form prevents its being sung in
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
modern congregations, it is at least one of those
spiritual songs which we should preserve for the hour
of private devotion.</p>
<h4>A HYMN TO GOD THE FATHER</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wilt Thou forgive that sin where I begun,</p>
<p class="t">Which was my sin, though it were done before?</p>
<p class="t0">Wilt Thou forgive that sin, through which I run,</p>
<p class="t">And do run still, though still I do deplore?</p>
<p class="t2">When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done,</p>
<p class="t5">For I have more.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I have won</p>
<p class="t">Others to sin, and made my sin their door?</p>
<p class="t0">Wilt Thou forgive that sin which I did shun</p>
<p class="t">A year or two, but wallowed in a score?</p>
<p class="t2">When Thou hast done, Thou hast not done,</p>
<p class="t5">For I have more.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I have a sin of fear, that when I&rsquo;ve spun</p>
<p class="t">My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;</p>
<p class="t0">But swear by Thyself, that at my death Thy Son</p>
<p class="t">Shall shine as He shines now, and heretofore;</p>
<p class="t2">And, having done that, Thou hast done;</p>
<p class="t5">I fear no more.</p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;I have the rather mentioned this hymn,&rsquo; says Izaak
Walton, &lsquo;for that he caused it to be set to a most grave
and solemn tune, and to be often sung to the organ by
the choristers of St. Paul&rsquo;s Church in his own hearing;
especially at the evening service, and at his return from his
customary devotions in that place, did occasionally say to
a friend: &ldquo;The words of this hymn have restored to me the
same thoughts of joy that possessed my soul in my sickness
when I composed it. And, O, the power of Church music!
that harmony added to this hymn has raised the affections
of my heart and quickened my graces of zeal and gratitude;
<span class="pb" id="Page_109">109</span>
and I observe that I always return from paying this public
duty of prayer and praise to God, with an unexpressible
tranquillity of mind, and a willingness to leave the world.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben Jonson&rsquo;s lovely Christmas hymn is to be
found in a few hymn-books to-day. Is it too much
to hope that it may yet become a familiar carol of
the Nativity?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I sing the Birth was born to-night,</p>
<p class="t0">The Author both of life and light;</p>
<p class="t">The angels so did sound it:&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">And like the ravished shepherds said,</p>
<p class="t0">Who saw the light, and were afraid,</p>
<p class="t">Yet searched, and true they found it.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Son of God, the eternal King,</p>
<p class="t0">That did us all salvation bring,</p>
<p class="t">And freed the soul from danger;</p>
<p class="t0">He whom the whole world could not take,</p>
<p class="t0">The Word, which heaven and earth did make,</p>
<p class="t">Was now laid in a manger.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What comfort by Him do we win,</p>
<p class="t0">Who made Himself the price of sin,</p>
<p class="t">To make us heirs of glory!</p>
<p class="t0">To see this Babe, all innocence,</p>
<p class="t0">A martyr born in our defence!&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Can man forget this story?</p>
</div>
<p>Robert Herrick&rsquo;s (1591-1674) quaint &lsquo;Litany to the
Holy Spirit&rsquo; yields a few verses to some of our best
modern collections, but his irrepressible humour makes
several verses impossible, and his references to &lsquo;furies
in a shole,&rsquo; to &lsquo;flames and hellish cares,&rsquo; shut out
others. In his <i>Noble Numbers</i> are many fine verses
and epigrams, but he is not a hymn-writer.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>George Herbert (1593-1632) did not write hymns
to be sung in church, though his &lsquo;Antiphon&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Elixir&rsquo; are, for love of their author, found in many
modern hymn-books, and &lsquo;Praise&rsquo; is also beautifully
possible as a hymn. Yet his loveliest poems cannot
be adapted to congregational use. He is the greatest
of the poets of the sanctuary, but he is not a chorister.
John Wesley and George Rawson tried to make
Herbert&rsquo;s poems into hymns, but with no great success&mdash;though
in one or two instances Wesley came near it.<a class="fn" id="fr_88" href="#fn_88">[88]</a>
In any collection of religious poetry for use in the
hour of private devotion, Herbert would rank among
the chief contributors, and it is well that he should
be represented in our hymn-books, if only that he may
be remembered and honoured by our children.<a class="fn" id="fr_89" href="#fn_89">[89]</a> He
is the chief singer of a school of poets in which Henry
Vaughan and Christina Rossetti are distinguished and
worthy disciples.</p>
<p>I give three of Herbert&rsquo;s poems. The first because
it is an ideal example of his quaint but exquisite
pathos, and of his gracious, humble, affectionate devotion
to his Lord; the others because they are the most
hymn-like of his poems.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<h4>LOVE</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love bade me welcome: yet my soul drew back,</p>
<p class="t3">Guilty of dust and sin.</p>
<p class="t0">But quick-eyed Love, observing me grow slack</p>
<p class="t3">From my first entrance in,</p>
<p class="t0">Drew nearer to me, sweetly questioning,</p>
<p class="t3">If I lacked any thing.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A guest, I answered, worthy to be here:</p>
<p class="t3">Love said, You shall be he.</p>

<p class="t3">I cannot look on Thee.</p>
<p class="t0">Love took my hand, and smiling did reply,</p>
<p class="t3">Who made the eyes, but I?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Truth, Lord, but I have marred them: let my shame</p>
<p class="t3">Go where it doth deserve.</p>
<p class="t0">And know you not, says Love, who bore the blame?</p>
<p class="t3">My Dear, then I will serve.</p>
<p class="t0">You must sit down, says Love, and taste my meat:</p>
<p class="t3">So I did sit and eat.</p>

<h4>PRAISE</h4>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Seven whole days, not one in seven,</p>

<p class="t0">Small it is, in this poor sort</p>
<p class="t2">To enrol Thee:</p>
<p class="t0">Even eternity&rsquo;s too short</p>

</div>
<h4>THE CALL</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, my Way, my Truth, my Life:</p>
<p class="t0">Such a Way, as gives us breath:</p>
<p class="t0">Such a Truth, as ends all strife:</p>
<p class="t0">Such a Life, as killeth death.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, my Light, my Feast, my Strength:</p>
<p class="t0">Such a Light, as shows a feast:</p>

<div class="verse">

<p>After Herbert comes Henry Vaughan (1621-95),
&lsquo;the Silurist,&rsquo; or South Wales man, who says that his
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
master was &lsquo;the blessed man, Mr. George Herbert,
whose holy life and verse gained many pious converts,
of whom I am the least.&rsquo; Vaughan had his devoted
admirers, but his verse never attained anything
approaching to the popularity of Herbert&rsquo;s. It was
long the fashion to ignore or disparage him, and it
was not till Henry Francis Lyte republished his <i>Sacred
Poems and Private Ejaculations</i>, with a brief memoir,
that he came to his rightful place amongst the minor,
but not to be forgotten, poets of the seventeenth
century. He was a mystic, and had visions Blake
might have envied.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I saw Eternity the other night,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a great ring of pure and endless light,</p>
<p class="t2">All calm as it was bright:</p>
<p class="t0">And round beneath it, Time, in hours, days, years,</p>
<p class="t2">Driven by the spheres,</p>
<p class="t0">Like a vast shadow moved, in which the world</p>
<p class="t2">And all her train were hurled.</p>
</div>
<p>Vaughan&rsquo;s songs have the marks of the true Christian
poet&mdash;intense devotion to Christ, humility, ecstasy.
His best-known hymns are&mdash;&lsquo;My soul, there is a
country,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Up to those bright and gladsome hills&rsquo;
(Ps. cxxi.). I give one less often quoted. Vaughan&rsquo;s
title is</p>
<h4>BEGGING</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">King of Mercy, King of Love,</p>

<p>Herbert and Vaughan were in the seventeenth
century what Heber and Keble were in the nineteenth.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>They set the tone of the Church of England, and they
revealed with no inefficient or temporary effect to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_115">115</span>

They united delicacy of taste in the choice of ornament
and of music with culture of expression and of reserve,

work and life.<a class="fn" id="fr_90" href="#fn_90">[90]</a></p>

<p>Henry More (1614-87) &lsquo;the Platonist,&rsquo; whom
Professor Palgrave calls &lsquo;the most interesting figure
among our poetical mystics,&rsquo; owes his place in our
hymn-books to John Wesley, who made from one of
More&rsquo;s &lsquo;Divine Hymns&rsquo; two numbers in his <i>Collection</i></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Father, if justly still we claim,</p>
</div>
<p>and a fine missionary hymn</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">On all the earth Thy Spirit shower,</p>
<p class="t">The earth in righteousness renew,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy kingdom come and hell&rsquo;s o&rsquo;erpower,</p>
<p class="t">And to Thy sceptre all subdue.</p>
</div>
<p>John Norris (1657-1711), who succeeded&mdash;sixty
years intervening&mdash;George Herbert as Parson of
Bemerton, was a Platonist of the school of More, for
whom he had unbounded admiration, saying</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Others in learning&rsquo;s chorus bear their part,</p>
<p class="t">And the great work distinctly share:</p>
<p class="t0">Thou our great catholic professor art,</p>
<p class="t">All science is annexed to thy unerring chair.</p>
</div>
<p>John Wesley and Dr. Martineau tried to make
Norris&rsquo;s poems available for congregational use, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_116">116</span>
his name is linked with those of Ken and Mason in
the preface to the Moravian book of 1754, but he
can never take a place among hymn-writers.</p>
<p>Bishop Jeremy Taylor (1613-67) wrote a number
of hymns, most of them being published in his <i>Golden
Grove</i>, but they are unsuited for congregational use.
His &lsquo;Advent Hymn&rsquo; has, however, been adapted with
admirable skill, and has a place in many hymnals.
It is perhaps as good a specimen of this kind of
&lsquo;translation&rsquo; as can be found. I give Taylor&rsquo;s original
first, and afterwards the version of the <i>Sarum Hymnal</i>,
which is said to have been made by Earl Nelson.
There is another good version in the <i>Leeds Hymn-book</i>,
which has been adopted by Mr. Horder and others.</p>

<p>Near the end of the seventeenth century the New
Version of the Psalms appeared, under royal and
episcopal sanction, and began at once to supplant the
Old Version. The authors were both Irishmen.
Nahum Tate (1652-1715) was a very minor poet, who
<span class="pb" id="Page_118">118</span>
became Laureate in 1690. Nicholas Brady (1659-1726)
was, like Charles Wesley, a scholar of Westminster
and student of Christ Church. He entered
the Church in Ireland, but in later life held various
livings in England, being at one time Vicar of Stratford-on-Avon.
The New Version was published in 1696.</p>
<p>Many attempts had been made to depose the Old
Version from its supreme position as the hymn-book
of the English Church, and some by men of much
greater gifts than Sternhold, Hopkins, or any of their
fellows. But the innate conservatism of Englishmen,
and especially of English Churchmen, gave the
Old Version a long life. Moreover, no version was
sufficiently superior to it to win wide approval until
Tate and Brady produced the New Version and secured
royal &lsquo;permission&rsquo; for its use in churches. Without
this &lsquo;permission&rsquo; it would probably never have dislodged
the Old Version, though it owes something to
intrinsic merit. Compared with the great hymn-writers
of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Tate and
Brady are, as a rule, dull, pretentious, diffuse; but as
compared with their predecessors and the vast majority
of their successors, their version deserves more consideration
than it usually receives. Even in our own
day there are more of their psalms in our best hymn-books
than there are of Keble&rsquo;s. It is unfortunate
that neither of the authors was a man for whom it is
possible to feel any great regard, or in whom one can
take an interest.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">While shepherds watched their flocks by night,</p>
</div>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">As pants the hart for cooling streams,</p>
</div>
<p>or&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Through all the changing scenes of life?</p>
</div>
<p>There is about such songs a gracious simplicity worthy
of John Newton, who might well have written&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O make but trial of His love,</p>
<p class="t">Experience will decide.</p>
<p class="t0">How blessed they are, and only they,</p>

<p>or&mdash;</p>

<p class="t0">Extend to me that favour, Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou to Thy chosen dost afford:</p>

<p class="t0">Let Thy salvation visit me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O may I worthy prove to see</p>
<p class="t0">Thy saints in full prosperity;</p>
<p class="t0">That I the joyful choir may join,</p>
<p class="t0">And count Thy people&rsquo;s triumph mine.</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Watts and the Wesleys did not scruple to
borrow from the New Version, and Watts, with
characteristic modesty, is content to yield them &lsquo;the
preference of&rsquo; their &lsquo;poesy&rsquo; in some of their compositions.</p>
<p>Whatever its intrinsic merit or demerit, the New
Version rendered an important service in breaking the
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
monopoly enjoyed by the Old Version, and thus preparing
the way for a larger view of Christian psalmody.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One condemned to tread the waste of metrical Psalters
will consider it an advance on its predecessors, suffering
more from its own success than comparison with them....
They asserted successfully, and with an emphasis scarcely
known before, literary and poetical excellence (according
to their light) as a principle of translation, and the
precedent thus set was seldom ignored afterwards.<a class="fn" id="fr_91" href="#fn_91">[91]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tate, being Laureate, naturally considered the state
occasions on which psalms were to be used. The
sentiments, at least, of his version of Ps. cl., which
is appointed for the day of the Sovereign&rsquo;s accession,
are excellent.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The private slanderer shall be</p>
<p class="t0">In public justice doomed by me.</p>
<p class="t0">From haughty looks I&rsquo;ll turn aside,</p>
<p class="t0">And mortify the heart of pride.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But honesty, called from her cell</p>
<p class="t0">In splendour at my court shall dwell.</p>
<p class="t0">Who virtue&rsquo;s practice make their care,</p>
<p class="t0">Shall have the first preferments there.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No politics shall recommend</p>
<p class="t0">His country&rsquo;s foe to be my friend:</p>
<p class="t0">None e&rsquo;er shall to my favour rise</p>
<p class="t0">By flattering or malicious lies.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All those who wicked courses take,</p>
<p class="t0">An early sacrifice I&rsquo;ll make;</p>
<p class="t0">Cut off, destroy, till none remain</p>
<p class="t0">God&rsquo;s holy city to profane.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>With the publication of the New Version a new
era began. It was to be the last &lsquo;authorized&rsquo; metrical
version. Hymns of the modern type were beginning
to be known, and soon there would be hymns in
abundance.<a class="fn" id="fr_92" href="#fn_92">[92]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="ch7"><span class="h2line1">IV</span>
<br />Eighteenth-century Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c8">I.&mdash;<span class="sc">The School of Watts</span></h3>
<p>The greater sacred poets of the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries spoke, for the most
part, to themselves and to God; their hymns
are of the study and the oratory. But with the
eighteenth century a new era began. Its chief hymn-writers
were ministers of religion, accustomed to offer
prayer and praise, not only for themselves, but for the
people. Their hymns were for the congregation and
the religious society. They were written with the
distinct intention of providing for common need; and
in the Nonconformist Churches hymns supplied the
place of the rejected liturgy, enabling the congregation
to unite in praise and prayer.</p>
<p>The earlier centuries give us many rich devotional
poems, few of which are entirely suited to the public
worship of our time. But we now reach, what
George Macdonald calls, &lsquo;the zone of hymn-writing,&rsquo;
and are embarrassed by the plenteousness of the stores
available for use in the service of the sanctuary.
Moreover, by this time modern English has become
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
fairly established, and there are few archaic expressions
to distract the unlearned.</p>
<p>Whatever may be said of the metrical Psalters, no
one can doubt that we are in an ampler, purer air
when we listen to Isaac Watts (1674-1748). Brighter
days were dawning for the religious life of England,
and especially for the Nonconformists. Yet as a babe
Isaac Watts was nursed by his mother as she sat on a
stone near the door of the prison where his father
was confined for conscience&rsquo; sake. But by the time
he was a man the sky had cleared, and there is little
in his hymns to recall the times of trouble except
the version of Ps. lxxv., &lsquo;applied to the glorious
revolution by King William or the happy accession of
King George to the throne,&rsquo; in which these verses
occur&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Britain was doomed to be a slave;</p>
<p class="t">Her frame dissolved, her fears were great,</p>
<p class="t0">When God a new supporter gave,</p>
<p class="t">To hear the pillars of the State.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">No vain pretence to royal birth,</p>
<p class="t">Shall fix a tyrant on the throne;</p>
<p class="t0">God, the great Sovereign of the earth,</p>
<p class="t">Will rise and make His justice known.</p>
</div>
<p>His own life was happy, and its story is singularly
attractive. His feeble health saved him from many
a rough conflict, and called forth the affectionate
hospitality of Sir Thomas and Lady Abney. It was
seemly that the non-juring Bishop Ken should find
a home with a peer of the realm at Longleat, but
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
Dr. Watts found an even more congenial refuge at
Theobalds and at Abney Park. There are few pleasanter
stories than that of Lady Huntingdon&rsquo;s calling
upon Dr. Watts, when he said to her, &lsquo;Madam, you have
come to see me on a very remarkable day. This day
thirty years I came hither to the house of my good
friend, Sir Thomas, intending to spend but a week
under his hospitable roof, and I have extended my
visit to thirty long years.&rsquo; &lsquo;Sir,&rsquo; said his gracious
hostess, Lady Abney, &lsquo;what you term a long thirty
years&rsquo; visit, I consider as the shortest visit my family
ever received.&rsquo;</p>
<p>If the world had dealt a little less kindly with the
poet, it might have been all the better for his poetry,
which lacks the vigour, the martial music, the glorious
enthusiasm of Luther and of Charles Wesley. He was,
it is true, not without at least one coarse and bitter
adversary&mdash;Thomas Bradbury, a Nonconformist minister
of some fame and more notoriety; who seems, without
any special reason, to have regarded Dr. Watts as a
suitable mark for his vehement and vulgar abuse. He
sneeringly forbade &lsquo;Watts&rsquo;s <i>whims</i>&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_93" href="#fn_93">[93]</a> to be sung in
his congregation, and charged the saintly poet with
&lsquo;burlesquing&rsquo; the poetry of the most High God. He
led, if he did not initiate, the charge of Arianism.
Had Watts been as ready for a theological fray as
<span class="pb" id="Page_125">125</span>
John Wesley, or even John Fletcher, Bradbury would
have had judgement without mercy. But Watts&rsquo;s
letters in reply to these reiterated accusations are
models of Christian controversy, or rather of Christian
remonstrance. Their last encounter was at a meeting
where Watts&rsquo;s feebleness made it difficult for him to
make himself heard. &lsquo;Shall I speak for you, Brother
Watts?&rsquo; asked Bradbury. &lsquo;Well, you have often spoken
<i>against</i> me,&rsquo; was the gently sarcastic reply.</p>
<p>Bradbury&rsquo;s malice can have done Watts little real
harm, except that of establishing the suspicion in
a good many minds that he leaned to Unitarianism&mdash;a
charge which has been repeated to our own day. The
mild and colourless character of many of Watts&rsquo;s hymns
made them favourites with Unitarian editors of a former
time; but the author of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Not all the blood of beasts</p>
<p class="t0">On Jewish altars slain,</p>
</div>
<p>and of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When I survey the wondrous Cross,</p>
</div>
<p>is not to be claimed as Arian, Unitarian, or anything
other than an evangelical believer.</p>
<p>Our concern is with Watts as a hymn-writer rather
than as a theologian. He was the first man, able to
write good hymns, who set himself seriously to secure
freedom in worship. In the meeting-house at Southampton
he wearied of the dull and halting verse of
Barton, and was not slow to accept his father&rsquo;s challenge
to write something better. If tradition may be relied
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
on, his first hymn, written during the week and sung
on the following Sunday, was that which he placed first
in his <i>Hymns and Spiritual Songs</i>, with the title:</p>
<h4>A NEW SONG TO THE LAMB THAT WAS SLAIN</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc">(Rev. v. 6, 8, 9-12.)</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Behold the glories of the Lamb,</p>
<p class="t">Amidst His Father&rsquo;s throne:</p>
<p class="t0">Prepare new honours for His Name,</p>
<p class="t">And songs before unknown.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let elders worship at His feet,</p>
<p class="t">The Church adore around,</p>
<p class="t0">With vials full of odours sweet,</p>
<p class="t">And harps of sweeter sound.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Those are the prayers of the saints,</p>
<p class="t">And these the hymns they raise:</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus is kind to our complaints,</p>
<p class="t">He loves to hear our praise.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Eternal Father, who shall look</p>
<p class="t">Into Thy secret will?</p>
<p class="t0">Who but the Son shall take that book</p>
<p class="t">And open every seal?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He shall fulfil Thy great decrees,</p>
<p class="t">The Son deserves it well;</p>
<p class="t0">Lo, in His hand the sovereign keys</p>
<p class="t">Of heaven, and death, and hell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now to the Lamb that once was slain,</p>
<p class="t">Be endless blessings paid;</p>
<p class="t0">Salvation, glory, joy remain</p>
<p class="t">For ever on Thy head.</p>
</div>
<p>This is far from being one of Watts&rsquo;s best hymns,
but it is vastly better than Barton&rsquo;s best.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>It is characteristic of Dr. Watts that in the preface
to his <i>Psalms</i> he speaks courteously of his predecessors
in the attempt to adapt the Psalms to modern use. He
praises Sir John Denham, Luke Milbourne, Tate and
Brady, and, most of all, Dr. Patrick, whose &lsquo;chief
excellency,&rsquo; he thought, was that &lsquo;he departed further
from the inspired words of Scripture&rsquo; than others had
done. Watts&rsquo;s hymns were published ten or twelve
years before the <i>Psalms</i>, and in his preface he delivers
a vigorous apology for what he felt to be a bold
venture, but pays no compliment to predecessors.
He could not say, like John Wesley, that but a small
part were of his own composing, yet even his extreme
modesty does not prevent his showing a quiet and most
just confidence in his work as compared with what had
been hitherto available. His picture of the public
worship of his day may comfort us in regard to the
attractiveness of modern services. He says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While we sing the praises of our God in His Church,
we are employed in that part of worship which of all others
is the nearest akin to heaven, and it is pity that this, of
all others, should be performed the worst upon earth. The
gospel brings us nearer to the heavenly state than all the
former dispensations of God amongst men. And in these
last days of the gospel we are brought almost within sight
of the kingdom of our Lord; yet we are very much unacquainted
with the songs of the New Jerusalem, and
unpractised in the work of praise. To see the dull indifference,
the negligent and the thoughtless air, that sits
upon the faces of a whole assembly, while the psalm is on
their lips, might tempt even a charitable observer to suspect
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
the fervency of inward religion; and it is much to be
feared that the minds of most of the worshippers are absent
or unconcerned. Perhaps the modes of preaching, in the
best churches, still want some degrees of reformation; nor
are the methods of prayer so perfect as to stand in need of
no correction or improvement. But of all our religious
solemnities, psalmody is the most unhappily managed.
That very action which should elevate us to the most
delightful and divine sensations, doth not only flatten our
devotion, but too often awakes our regret, and touches all
the springs of uneasiness within us.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He goes on to protest that it was &lsquo;far from&rsquo; his
&lsquo;thoughts to lay aside the book of Psalms in public
worship,&rsquo; which &lsquo;is the most noble, most devotional
and divine collection of poesy.&rsquo; At the same time he
says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It must be acknowledged still that there are a thousand
lines in it which were not made for a Church in our days to
assume as its own. There are also many deficiencies of
light and glory which our Lord Jesus and His apostles
have supplied in the writings of the New Testament. And
with this advantage I have composed these spiritual songs,
which are now presented to the world. Nor is the attempt
vain-glorious or presuming, for, in respect of clear evangelical
knowledge, <i>The least in the kingdom of heaven is
greater than all the Jewish prophets</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Such a defence of Christian hymns is superfluous
to-day, but it took many long years to convince the
Churches that &lsquo;When I survey the wondrous Cross&rsquo;
was more suitable for use in Christian worship than
Ps. cix.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>When Watts&rsquo;s victory was achieved it was only too
complete. In the congregations of his own denomination
it was counted almost an impiety to sing anything but
his psalms and hymns. This extravagant and narrow
loyalty to Watts naturally placed the Dissenting
congregations at a great disadvantage&mdash;far greater than
that which the Methodist societies suffered through
the too exclusive use of Wesley&rsquo;s hymns. The idea
that one man can write the hymns of any Church or
congregation is long since exploded; indeed, we go
further, claiming that a good hymn belongs to Christendom.
We do not ask what a man&rsquo;s &lsquo;denomination&rsquo;
is before giving him a place in our hymn-books. Only
the Romanists, and some of them faint-heartedly, now
demand that the writer and the singer must belong to
the same communion.</p>
<p>Watts has been at once unduly lauded and unduly
depreciated. Keble spoke of him as &lsquo;no poet,&rsquo;
and this may be true of his &lsquo;poems,&rsquo; but his greater
hymns could only have been written by a poet
of no mean order. Montgomery puts the case more
justly when he calls Watts &lsquo;one of the least of the
poets of his country,&rsquo; but &lsquo;the greatest name among
hymn-writers.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_94" href="#fn_94">[94]</a> Professor Palgrave does Watts full
justice&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>His views as an Independent were modified and enlarged
by his sweet, devout temper&mdash;may we not add, by
his gift in poetry? And &lsquo;every Christian Church,&rsquo; as
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
Dr. Johnson finely remarked, &lsquo;would rejoice to have
adopted&rsquo; one so fervently devout, so faithful to his duty&mdash;we
may add, so much more truly gifted by nature as a poet
than common Fame has recognized. As with C. Wesley
and other good men, fluency, want of taste and finish, the
sacrifice, in a word, of art to direct usefulness, have
probably lost them those honours in literature to which
they were born. But they have their reward.<a class="fn" id="fr_95" href="#fn_95">[95]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The sacrifice of art to usefulness was much more
deliberate in the case of Watts than of Wesley. Charles
Wesley often wrote in haste, with the rush and glow of
a present inspiration, with thoughts that must find
expression, and which it was easier to utter in poetry
than in prose. Watts designed his hymns for the
service of the house of God, and had ever before him
the dull man in the pew and the tiresome man in the
singing gallery. &lsquo;I have seldom,&rsquo; he explained, &lsquo;permitted
a stop in the middle of a line, and seldom left
the end of a line without one; to comport with the
unhappy mixture of reading and singing, which cannot
presently be reformed.&rsquo; &lsquo;The metaphors,&rsquo; he continues,
&lsquo;are generally sunk to the level of vulgar capacities.
If the verse appears so gentle and flowing as to incur
the censure of feebleness, I may honestly affirm that
sometimes it cost me labour to make it so. Some of
the beauties of poesy are neglected, and some wilfully
defaced.&rsquo; Finally, he describes his work as &lsquo;an attempt
for the reformation of psalmody amongst the Churches.&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
In estimating Watts&rsquo;s contribution to the hymn-book
of the modern Church, this service must be gratefully
recognized. It may seem to us that he stooped too much
&lsquo;to the level of vulgar capacities,&rsquo; but in this he had
to consider what men were able to bear; and we
must remember that even those of his hymns which
were to perish in the using had their share in preparing
the way for the &lsquo;nobler, sweeter song&rsquo; in which the
Church praises her Lord to-day.</p>
<p>When the Independent Churches began to seek
a wider range of choice than Watts could afford, they
proceeded by way of supplement, as the Methodists
did until 1903. Dr. Thomas Gibbons, Watts&rsquo;s affectionate
but ponderous biographer,<a class="fn" id="fr_96" href="#fn_96">[96]</a> issued one in 1769,
and others followed in fairly rapid succession, amongst
their editors being George Burder, Dr. Bengo Collyer,
and finally Josiah Conder, whose book was prepared
in 1833 under the direction of the Congregational
Union.<a class="fn" id="fr_97" href="#fn_97">[97]</a> When at length the Congregationalists began
to compile completely new books, Watts naturally
still exercised a preponderating influence&mdash;as in the excellent
<i>Leeds Hymn-book</i> of 1853. But each successive
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
official or unofficial publication emanating from the
Congregational Churches has been marked by a great
reduction in the number of Watts&rsquo;s hymns, so that
the present <i>Congregational Church Hymnal</i> contains
fewer hymns by Watts than were included by
Dr. Martineau in his <i>Hymns for the Church and Home</i>.
If we turn to the hymn-books of other Churches,
the reduction in the number of hymns by Dr. Watts
is even more striking; e.g. the <i>Church Hymnary</i> (Presbyterian)
gives only nine, and <i>Church Hymns</i> only
fourteen.</p>
<p>At present it would seem as though Dr. Watts
were more honoured in the Methodist Churches than
among his own people, the Methodist and the Primitive
Methodist each giving a larger number of his
pieces than either the Congregational or Baptist hymn-books.
Probably the number of Watts&rsquo;s hymns in
common use will be further reduced. Some inferior
compositions still hold their place. They are survivals
of a time when the Church&rsquo;s hymn-book was vastly
poorer than it is to-day. But when the lowest point is
touched, there must ever remain a number of imperishable
hymns which will be sung in the Church of Christ
as long as it is militant here on earth.</p>
<p>Watts&rsquo;s hymns were greatly helped in public favour
by the publication of his <i>Psalms</i> in 1719. The Dissenting
Churches, for the most part, soon agreed with his
own judgement that the two books were &lsquo;such a sufficient
provision for psalmody as to answer most
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
occasions of the Christian&rsquo;s life.&rsquo; Long use had made
psalm-singing as a distinct part of the service essential,
and it was many years before the Dissenting Churches
cared for a hymn-book which did not make the
distinction between psalms and hymns. The place
of honour, or at least of precedence, was given to
the Psalms, and as far as possible every psalm was
paraphrased.</p>
<p>Watts&rsquo;s preface to <i>The Psalms of David Imitated in
the Language of the New Testament and Applied to the
Christian State and Worship</i> is a vigorous manifesto,
and it may well have seemed to some men as audacious
as many readers find Wesley&rsquo;s famous preface. His
chief contention was that Jewish psalms must be translated,
paraphrased, or, to use his own word, &lsquo;imitated&rsquo;
in Christian language before they are fit for use in
Christian worship. He specially emphasizes the small
number of psalms sung at the celebration of the
Lord&rsquo;s Supper, and, gaining courage as he writes, adds,
&lsquo;Though, to speak my own sense freely, I do not think
David ever wrote a psalm of sufficient glory and sweetness
to represent the blessings of this holy institution.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Acting upon this conviction Watts boldly departed
from the ideal of most of those who have paraphrased
the Psalter.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In all places I have kept my grand design in view,
and that is, to teach my author to speak like a Christian....
I have chosen rather to imitate than translate, and thus to
compose a psalm-book for Christians, after the manner of
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
the Jewish Psalter.... I have not been so curious and
exact in striving everywhere to express the ancient sense
and meaning of David, but have rather expressed myself as
I may suppose David would have done, had he lived in the
days of Christianity.<a class="fn" id="fr_98" href="#fn_98">[98]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not only does common sense confirm Watts&rsquo;s
general principle; his own success, partial though it
was, justified the new departure, and from his day to
ours the most useful and the most poetic versions of
Psalms are those which &lsquo;teach the author to speak like
a Christian.&rsquo; Yet, if a psalm could be dealt with from
the Old Testament standpoint without inappropriateness
to Christian worship, Watts preferred to retain
the original idea. Thus in all his versions of the
23rd Psalm he makes no reference to the Good
Shepherd of the New Testament. His best version&mdash;and
it is very good&mdash;is as suitable for the synagogue
as the meeting-house.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My Shepherd will supply my need;</p>
<p class="t">Jehovah is His Name;</p>
<p class="t0">In pastures fresh He makes me feed,</p>
<p class="t">Beside the living stream.</p>
</div>
<p>The <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i> omits the last verse, which
is given in most other collections&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_135">135</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There would I find a settled rest,</p>
<p class="t">While others go and come;</p>
<p class="t0">No more a stranger or a guest,</p>
<p class="t">But like a child at home.</p>
</div>
<p>It is a beautiful paraphrase of &lsquo;Thy house for ever.&rsquo;
He felt, however, that his experiment was so novel and
so likely to provoke adverse criticism, that he continually
explained or defended his versions in notes appended to
the psalms, which form a sort of running commentary.</p>
<p>Watts&rsquo;s <i>Psalms</i> mark the passage from psalm-singing
to hymn-singing. Slowly but surely the
distinction disappears from modern hymn-books, and
psalm-versions take their place amongst &lsquo;hymns.&rsquo;
This was not Watts&rsquo;s design, but it is a part of the
success of his enterprise. If to-day we had to make
choice of any one metrical version of the Psalter
for use in Christian worship, it would be impossible to
find anything better than Watts&rsquo;s. Indeed, if feeble
&lsquo;aliters&rsquo; (to use Barton&rsquo;s phrase) and poor verses were
omitted, the result would show how near he came to
achieving success.</p>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the service rendered to
the worship of the Christian Church by Dr. Watts.
As Lord Selborne says, &lsquo;He was the first to understand
the nature of the want,&rsquo; and he &lsquo;led the way in providing
for it.&rsquo; Yet it is easy to quote poor verses, to
find lines that are intolerably flat. His rhymes are
often either discordant in the extreme or lacking
altogether. Sometimes he is too colloquial, as in</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_136">136</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Well, the Redeemer&rsquo;s gone</p>
<p class="t0">To appear before our God.</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps no hymn-writer needs editing so much
as Watts, and certainly none has been edited more
skilfully. Not a few of his hymns owe their place
in our hymnals to the judicious way in which they
have been &lsquo;improved.&rsquo; We cannot dispute Dr.
Johnson&rsquo;s criticism</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The rhymes are not always sufficiently correspondent....
His lines are commonly smooth and easy, and his thoughts
always religiously pure; but who is there that, to so much
piety and innocence, does not wish for a greater measure of
sprightliness and vigour?<a class="fn" id="fr_99" href="#fn_99">[99]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hymn-writers are in a special degree affected by
their surroundings. There is an open-air life in
many of the psalms attributed to David which is
lacking in those&mdash;e.g. the cxix.&mdash;which belong to a
more formal age. Watts was a student, a scholar,
a recluse, an invalid, who yet came into frequent
contact with the Church life of the Independents.
He could not be coarse or fantastic, and he both consciously
and conscientiously condescended to men of
low estate. The sacrifice of his own taste to that of
the unlearned reader was part of his offering to the
Lord, and it did not cost him nothing. The pity of it
is that he misjudged and under-estimated the intelligence
of those who would use his hymns. It is but
just to bear his self-imposed limitation in mind, yet
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
it must also be allowed that, like many a far greater
poet&mdash;Wordsworth, for example&mdash;he did not know
which were the superior and which the inferior pieces.
He believed his <i>Lyrics</i> to be his best poetical work,
and possibly this may have been the judgement of his
friendly contemporaries; but the severer taste of later
times has forgotten the <i>Lyrics</i> while treasuring the
hymns.</p>
<p>Watts seldom writes without a consciousness of
the congregation for whose use he intended his hymns.
The story&mdash;probably true&mdash;that he undertook to write
one every week for the Independent Chapel at
Southampton explains the character of very many
of them, and accounts at once for their strength and
weakness. On the one hand, he avoided the tiresome
verbosity of Tate and Brady and the halting rhythm
of Barton and, on the other, he abstained from the
&lsquo;conceits&rsquo; which are the charm of Herbert and Vaughan,
but which make many a lovely poem impossible as
a hymn. The ease and simplicity of his best hymns,
which no hymn-writer surpasses and few have attained,
endeared them to &lsquo;men of heart sincere,&rsquo; alike among
the unlearned and ignorant and among men of culture.
He has that sweet, plaintive undertone of perplexity
concerning the mysteries of life and death which touches
all thoughtful souls, and is so true to the inner life of
one whose many infirmities made him die daily. He
had in large measure the rich indwelling of the
word of God without which a man may write hymns,
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
but can never be one of God&rsquo;s great singers. His hymns
are full of scriptural phrases, though less so than those
of Charles Wesley, and he has many happy and
instructive applications of passages both from the Old
and New Testament. Take, for instance, one of his
sacramental hymns, in which he uses the parable of
the Great Supper as a type of the Supper of the Lord&mdash;an
application singularly appropriate, though not often
made.<a class="fn" id="fr_100" href="#fn_100">[100]</a></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How rich are Thy provisions, Lord,</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_139">139</div>
<p>The &lsquo;sacramentarian&rsquo; element is naturally absent
from Watts&rsquo;s twenty-five hymns &lsquo;prepared for the
holy ordinance of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper,&rsquo; which are, with
a few exceptions, much less solemn and impressive
than those of Wesley. Two have, however, a permanent
place among our Communion hymns. The seventh
of the series, &lsquo;Crucifixion to the World by the Cross of
Christ&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When I survey the wondrous Cross</p>
</div>
<p>is so great a hymn, and consecrated by so many
hallowed associations, that comment is superfluous and
criticism impertinent. The third, &lsquo;The New Testament
in the Blood of Christ, or The New Covenant Sealed,&rsquo;
is absent from the chief hymnals to-day with the
exception of the Methodist, to which it was added in
1830. It begins&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;The promise of my Father&rsquo;s love</p>
<p class="t">Shall stand for ever good,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">He said; and gave His soul to death,</p>
<p class="t">And sealed the grace with blood.</p>
</div>
<p>Watts wrote no great festival hymns to be compared
with &lsquo;Hark! how all the welkin rings,&rsquo; or &lsquo;Hail the day
that sees Him rise.&rsquo; His best work is found in his
hymns and spiritual songs, some of which are among
the most spiritual and most scriptural ever written. The
tone of triumph is comparatively rare, though now and
again, as in &lsquo;Join all the glorious names,&rsquo; he rises as
high as ever Charles Wesley rose in his hymns for
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
&lsquo;Believers rejoicing.&rsquo; Such are, &lsquo;My God, the spring
of all my joys&rsquo;; &lsquo;Come, we that love the Lord&rsquo;;
&lsquo;Jesus shall reign where&rsquo;er the sun&rsquo;; &lsquo;Come, let us
join our cheerful songs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>To Dr. Watts, with his delicate health and protracted
sicknesses, songs in a minor key were peculiarly
suitable, and some of his most precious hymns are those
which speak of the life to come. He seldom writes of
death as Wesley does, and such a line as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ah, lovely appearance of death</p>
</div>
<p>would have been impossible to him; but no Christian
poet has touched the sorrows of our hearts more
tenderly or comforted the bereaved more wisely than
he has done in such a hymn as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Give me the wings of faith to rise;</p>
</div>
<p>while</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There is a land of pure delight</p>
</div>
<p>has voiced the thoughts of myriads of anxious souls, to
whom only &lsquo;a prospect of heaven&rsquo; could make &lsquo;death
easy.&rsquo; Watts seldom, if ever, showed the ecstasy of
Charles Wesley. He never sang</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The promised land, from Pisgah&rsquo;s top,</p>
<p class="t">I now exult to see;</p>
</div>
<p>but he knew that</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Could we but climb where Moses stood,</p>
<p class="t">And view the landscape o&rsquo;er,</p>
<p class="t0">Not Jordan&rsquo;s stream nor death&rsquo;s cold flood</p>
<p class="t">Should fright us from the shore.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_141">141</div>
<p>There are few more tender lines than the verse in
his hymn for &lsquo;The Death and Burial of a Saint&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The graves of all His saints He blessed,</p>
<p class="t">And softened every bed:</p>
<p class="t0">Where should the dying members rest,</p>
<p class="t">But with their dying Head?</p>
</div>
<p>But Dr. Watts was not a man whose whole thought
was centred on the world to come. After the fashion
not only of his own time, but of the religious men of
most times, he speaks slightingly of earth and its
charms; but when he allows himself to dwell on its
beauty and glory he writes, I think, with a clearer
and more poetic vision than Wesley, as in his &lsquo;Song
to Creating Wisdom&rsquo;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Eternal Wisdom, Thee we praise.</p>
</div>
<p>The hymns of Dr. Watts are so well known that it
is difficult to select any that would worthily represent
him without repeating what is already familiar to every
reader. &lsquo;The Cradle Song&rsquo; is one of the most delightful
lullabies ever written, and shows Watts in a charming
and unexpected light.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hush! my dear, lie still and slumber;</p>

<p class="t0">Heavenly blessings without number</p>
<p class="t">Gently falling on thy head.</p>

</div>
<p>From Isaac Watts we turn naturally to Philip
Doddridge (1702-51), another name which is amongst
the glories of the Nonconforming Churches, and of him
also it may be said that every Christian Church would
rejoice to have adopted him. He was the twentieth
child of his parents, was all his life in delicate health,
and died of consumption at Lisbon, where he was
buried in the English cemetery. His life was happy
and devout from the earliest days, when he learnt from
his mother&rsquo;s lips the Bible stories which were illustrated
by the Dutch tiles in the fireplace in his childhood&rsquo;s
home in London&mdash;&lsquo;London! dear city of my youth!&rsquo;
On his father&rsquo;s side he was descended from a good stock
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
of English gentlemen, some of whom were men of
renown in their own generation. His father was a
tradesmen, but his grandfather was Rector of Shepperton
until the Act of Uniformity made him a Nonconformist.
His mother was the daughter of a Protestant
refugee from Bohemia, whose Bible (Luther&rsquo;s version)
he kept as his most cherished possession. As a child
he attracted the notice of the Duchess of Bedford, who
offered to send him to Oxford or Cambridge, and to
provide a living for him if he took orders in the
Church of England. He declined the offer, though
discouraged by the great Dissenter, Calamy, in his
purpose of entering the Independent ministry. But
his old friend and pastor, Samuel Clark, of St. Albans
(author of <i>Scripture Promises</i>), encouraged him, bidding
him come to his house and make it his home during
his preliminary studies.</p>
<p>Like Watts, he was a scholar and a gentleman, and
was revered and loved in all Churches. Doddridge was
a man of broad views and wide sympathies, and was
honoured by the enmity of Watts&rsquo;s old adversary,
Thomas Bradbury, whose &lsquo;zeal and fury&rsquo; in opposing
&lsquo;Moravians and Methodists and all who will not go
his length in putting them down&rsquo; he deprecated.
Indeed, his sympathy with Methodism led less vehement
Dissenters than Bradbury to remonstrate with
him, and when he not only preached at Whitefield&rsquo;s
Tabernacle, but invited that great evangelist to preach
in his chapel at Northampton, even moderate men in
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
his own communion thought he had given just offence
to the Nonconformist conscience of the day. He
found it necessary to explain and apologize for his
patronage of the enthusiasm which sober Churchmen
and Dissenters alike abhorred.</p>
<p>His hymns were often written to be sung in his
own chapel at the Castle Hill, Northampton, and
were upon the subjects of his sermons. Written on
the same principle as Watts&rsquo;s hymns, they belong to
the same class; and while they are on the whole
inferior to those of Watts, they make a distinct and
very precious addition to our hymnals. There is less
variety of theme, metre, and expression in Doddridge
than in Watts, but he is rarely so completely on the
level of the &lsquo;vulgar capacities&rsquo; for whom his great
predecessor had such a tender regard. His hymns are
the prayers and praises of a saint, &lsquo;they shine,&rsquo; as
Montgomery said, &lsquo;in the beauty of holiness,&rsquo; and
some must live while Christianity endures.</p>
<p>He is like Watts also in his indebtedness to editors.
The best known of the hymns that bear his name, &lsquo;O
God of Bethel,&rsquo; would make a fine specimen for a
polychrome hymn-book, though I venture to suggest
that no &lsquo;higher critic&rsquo; could pick out the portions
supplied by the various revisers if he were left solely
to subjective considerations. Dr. Julian says that its
authorship should be thus described&mdash;&lsquo;P. Doddridge,
Jan. 173&#8310;/&#8327; Scottish Trs. and Paraphs., 1745; J. Logan,
1781; and Scottish Paraphs., 1781.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="t0">O happy day that fixed my choice.</p>
</div>
<p>This also has been edited to its advantage. It has
been the birthday song of countless redeemed souls.
Dr. A. B. Bruce says that St. Matthew&rsquo;s feast, at which
&lsquo;a great company of publicans and of others sat down,&rsquo;
&lsquo;was a kind of poem, saying for Matthew what Doddridge&rsquo;s
familiar lines say for many another.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_104" href="#fn_104">[104]</a></p>
<p>Contemporary with Watts and Doddridge, but
having closer spiritual affinity with John Bunyan, was
Joseph Hart (1712-68), whose hymns, with two or
three exceptions, have almost disappeared from our
hymnals, though in older books, and in Spurgeon&rsquo;s
<i>Our Own Hymn-book</i>, they are fairly numerous. To
the first edition of his hymns he prefixed &lsquo;a brief
summary account of the great things&rsquo; God had &lsquo;done
for&rsquo; his &lsquo;soul,&rsquo; which, but for its Calvinism, might
have been written by one of the early Methodist
preachers. Again and again this narrative recalls
<i>Grace Abounding</i>, though Hart has little of the vigour,
and none of the humour, of Bunyan. He was &lsquo;born of
believing parents,&rsquo; but after his conversion he &lsquo;hasted
to make myself a Christian by mere doctrine, adopting
other men&rsquo;s opinions before I had tried them.&rsquo; The
result was, according to his own account, a deplorable
fall into the prevalent Antinomianism, against which
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
Fletcher and Wesley wrote so energetically. After
seven or eight years &lsquo;in this abominable state&rsquo; he
&lsquo;began by degrees to reform a little,&rsquo; and in the week
before Easter, 1757, he had &lsquo;an amazing view of the
agony of Christ in the garden,&rsquo; which affected all his
after life. &lsquo;While these horrors remained&rsquo; he found
occasional comfort at Whitefield&rsquo;s Tabernacle in Moorfields,
or his chapel in Tottenham Court Road, but on
Whit Sunday (which was also Charles Wesley&rsquo;s Day
of Pentecost), at the Moravian chapel in Fetter Lane,
under a sermon on Rev. iii. 10, he felt &lsquo;deeply
impressed,&rsquo; and hastening home found himself &lsquo;melting
away with a strange softness of affection.&rsquo; His
experience was that of Christian at the Cross, his
&lsquo;burden&rsquo; under which he was &lsquo;almost sinking&rsquo; was
immediately taken from his shoulders. &lsquo;Tears ran in
streams from my eyes, and I was so swallowed up in
joy and thankfulness that I hardly knew where I
was.&rsquo; After this &lsquo;reconversion&rsquo; he had many Bunyan-like
temptations, but walked humbly with God, and
ministered till his death to the Independent church in
Jewin Street.</p>
<p>His hymns are said, in the &lsquo;advertisement&rsquo; to the
edition published after his death, to describe his preaching
exactly, and they are evidently the fruit of his own
experience.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The vicissitudes of a trembling faith, the alternations
of comfort and depression, the ever-recurring conflict
between grace and sin, and all the emotions of a soul
<span class="pb" id="Page_149">149</span>
&lsquo;ready to halt,&rsquo; but knowing where to look for strength,
are plentifully and feelingly represented. But he has little
acquaintance either with the joyful hope and buoyant
cheerfulness of Wesley or with the &lsquo;quietness and
confidence&rsquo; of Keble.<a class="fn" id="fr_105" href="#fn_105">[105]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He had a small poetic gift, and some of his hymns,
with their happy alliterations, quaint phrases, easy
rhythm, and, above all, their simple piety, have charm
and power. Dr. Johnson&rsquo;s estimate of Hart may be
inferred from a curious incident. &lsquo;I went to church.
I gave a shilling; and, seeing a poor girl at the sacrament
in a bed-gown, I gave her privately half a crown,
though I saw Hart&rsquo;s hymns in her hand.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The hymns by which he is, and will be, known,
are&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Holy Spirit, come,</p>
<p class="t">Let Thy bright beams arise.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched,</p>
</div>
<p>And</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">This God is the God we adore.</p>
</div>
<p>Some of his forgotten verses have real epigrammatic
force, e.g.&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If profit be thy scope,</p>
<p class="t">Diffuse thy alms about.</p>
<p class="t0">The worldling prospers laying up,</p>
<p class="t">The Christian laying out.</p>
</div>
<p>A few other hymn-writers belong to the Dissenting
Church of the eighteenth century, but they have passed
or are passing from our modern hymn-books. Simon
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
Browne (1680-1732), pastor of an Independent church
in Old Jewry, published in 1720 a supplement to
Watts, which shows how early Watts began to be
regarded as the standard hymn-book in Congregational
Churches. There is a pathetic interest in the strange
affliction from which he suffered. In 1723 he was
attacked by highwaymen, and defended himself with
such vigour that his adversary, when he released him,
was found to be dead. Browne was overwhelmed with
grief, and sank into a state of melancholy which was
deepened by family bereavement. &lsquo;He imagined that
God had in a gradual manner annihilated in him the
thinking substance,&rsquo; yet he continued his ministry, and
wrote many books, including an exposition of the First
Epistle to the Corinthians in Matthew Henry&rsquo;s <i>Commentary</i>.
His best-known hymn is still to be found in
many hymn-books.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Holy Spirit, heavenly Dove,</p>
<p class="t">My sinful maladies remove.</p>
</div>
<p>Its form is altered and improved, having passed
through the hands of many editors.</p>
<p>He was also the author of a penitential hymn,
which is much more impressive when given as Browne
wrote it in the first person singular. In other respects
editors have improved it by slight alterations.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, at Thy feet a sinner lies,</p>
<p class="t">And knocks at mercy&rsquo;s door;</p>
<p class="t0">With heavy heart and downcast eyes</p>

</div>
<p>Benjamin Beddome (1717-95) was for more than
half a century a Baptist minister at Bourton-on-the-Water,
refusing for the sake of his rustic flock the
attractions of a call to more conspicuous pastorates. &lsquo;I
would rather honour God,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;in a station even
much inferior to that in which He has placed me, than
intrude myself into a higher without His direction.&rsquo;
His hymns were written for his own congregation, and
usually to suit his sermon for the day.</p>
<p>There is not much to choose amongst Beddome&rsquo;s
pious verses. The following lines are interesting since
they may, perhaps, have suggested Montgomery&rsquo;s well-known
hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Prayer is the breath of God in man,</p>
<p class="t">Returning whence it came;</p>
<p class="t0">Love is the sacred fire within,</p>
<p class="t">And prayer the rising flame.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">It gives the burdened spirit ease,</p>
<p class="t">And soothes the troubled breast;</p>
<p class="t0">Yields comfort to the mourning soul,</p>
<p class="t">And to the weary rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_152">152</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When God inclines the heart to pray,</p>
<p class="t">He hath an ear to hear;</p>
<p class="t0">To Him there&rsquo;s music in a sigh,</p>
<p class="t">And beauty in a tear.</p>
</div>
<p>To these clerical hymn-writers of the school of
Watts must be added the name of Anne Steele
(1716-78), daughter of William Steele, timber-merchant
and Baptist minister at Broughton, Hants. Miss Steele
is the first Englishwoman who takes a permanent place
amongst hymn-writers. She has been called the Miss
Havergal of the eighteenth century, and so far as popularity
and piety are concerned the comparison is fair.
She wrote under the name of &lsquo;Theodosia,&rsquo; and her hymns
were for a hundred years extensively used in Nonconformist
worship, and several are to be found in Anglican
hymnals.</p>
<p>Dr. Watts was her acknowledged model. She
cries&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O for the animating fire</p>
<p class="t0">That tuned harmonious Watts&rsquo;s lyre,</p>
<p class="t2">To sweet seraphic strains!<a class="fn" id="fr_106" href="#fn_106">[106]</a></p>
</div>
<p>She was so modest and devout, suffered and sorrowed
so much, that one is glad to know that some at least of
her songs will take their place among the permanent
treasures of Christian song. Her hymns are generally
improved by the omission of some verses, and by slight
changes; but Miss Steele is never guilty of the clumsy
and offensive phrases which mar so many contemporary
hymns. Her best-known hymns are &lsquo;When I survey
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
life&rsquo;s varied scene,<a class="fn" id="fr_107" href="#fn_107">[107]</a> and &lsquo;Father of mercies, in Thy
word.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here are a few verses from a hymn on the text,
&lsquo;Because I live, ye shall live also&rsquo; (John xiv. 19)&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If my immortal Saviour lives,</p>
<p class="t">Then my immortal life is sure;</p>
<p class="t0">His word a firm foundation gives:</p>
<p class="t">Here let me build and rest secure.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here let my faith unshaken dwell:</p>
<p class="t">Immovable the promise stands;</p>
<p class="t0">Not all the powers of earth or hell</p>
<p class="t">Can e&rsquo;er dissolve the sacred bands.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here, O my soul, thy trust repose!</p>
<p class="t">If Jesus is for ever mine.</p>
<p class="t0">Not death itself, that last of foes,</p>
<p class="t">Shall break a union so divine.</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. John Ryland (1753-1825), one of the pioneers
of the modern missionary revival, and a few others are
still remembered as hymn-writers, but there is little
distinctive about their poetry. Indeed one is compelled
to admit that a very large portion of the hymns of
the school of Watts are dull, formal, and prosaic. For
the most part they were written to suit particular
sermons, and the shades of the meeting-house are about
them still. To many of them Montgomery&rsquo;s criticism
of Beddome applies: &lsquo;His compositions are calculated
to be far more useful than attractive.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The &lsquo;atmosphere&rsquo; was hardly likely to inspire
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
enthusiasm. The long struggle between King and
Parliament, Catholic and Protestant was stilled, the
Toleration Act (1689) had given to orthodox Nonconformists
a religious liberty unknown before, and, though
there were occasional fears lest the old, bad conditions
should be revived, their freedom became gradually
larger and more thoroughly established. Watts and
Doddridge represent the best side of the Nonconformity
which settled down after &lsquo;the glorious Revolution&rsquo; into
sedate, intelligent, unaggressive, and highly respectable
Churches, rejoicing devoutly, but without enthusiasm,
in the right to worship God in their own sanctuaries,
and to &lsquo;sit under&rsquo; the ministry of their own pastors.
&lsquo;Then had the Churches rest, and walking in the
comfort of the Holy Ghost were multiplied.&rsquo; The
high character and sound scholarship of the leading
Nonconformist ministers compelled the respect and
won the esteem of their episcopalian neighbours, with
whom they lived in pleasant relationships. It was just
the time for a quiet reform in modes of worship, and
it was in the years between the Toleration Act and
the Methodist Revival that the hymn, already known
but not yet loved, won its way to a sure and increasingly
honourable place in the service of the
sanctuary. Had the hymns been more original and
aggressive in tone, they would not so readily have
won the ear and heart of Independent congregations
at the beginning of the eighteenth century.</p>

<h2 title=""><span class="h2line1">IV</span>
<br />Eighteenth-century Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c9">II.&mdash;<span class="sc">Hymns of the Methodist Revival</span></h3>
<p>The first Wesleyan hymn-book is earlier than
the Evangelical Revival. When John Wesley
sailed for Georgia, he took with him Herbert&rsquo;s
<i>Poems</i>, Watts&rsquo;s <i>Psalms and Hymns</i>, and John Austin&rsquo;s
<i>Offices</i>. From these and some other books he prepared
&lsquo;the first hymn-book compiled for use in the Church
of England.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_108" href="#fn_108">[108]</a> It was published at Charlestown in
1737, and is entitled, <i>A Collection of Psalms and Hymns</i>.
The book is a &lsquo;Christian week&rsquo; rather than a Christian
year, being divided into three sections&mdash;for Sunday; for
Wednesday and Friday; for Saturday. It is in many
respects a most interesting volume. There is little
trace of &lsquo;catholic&rsquo; doctrine, unless it be in the verses
taken from Austin&rsquo;s <i>Office of the Saints</i>, and there is
less of sacramental teaching than in the present
<i>Methodist Hymn-book</i>.</p>
<p>Of the seventy hymns half are by Dr. Watts, and
amongst these are his version of Ps. c, with Wesley&rsquo;s
famous first lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Before Jehovah&rsquo;s awful throne,</p>
<p class="t">Ye nations, bow with sacred joy;</p>
</div>
<p>and the cxlvi., which Wesley repeated with his dying
breath. Seven hymns are by John Austin; six are
moderately successful attempts to make some of
Herbert&rsquo;s matchless poems available for use in public
worship. The Wesleyan portion of the book consists
of five hymns by Samuel Wesley, senior; five by
Samuel Wesley, junior; and five translations from the
German by John Wesley himself. Charles Wesley&rsquo;s
hymns are conspicuous by their absence. Probably the
explanation is that, as he had already sailed for
England, his MSS. were not at his brother&rsquo;s disposal.</p>
<p>In 1738, on his return to England, John Wesley published
another small hymn-book, with the same title and
a similar arrangement, though the contents are different.
This is, I think, the only one of his many hymn-books
in which Ken&rsquo;s hymns are included. In 1739 the
brothers issued their first joint publication, &lsquo;<i>Hymns and
Sacred Poems</i>, published by John Wesley, M.A., Fellow
of Lincoln College, Oxford, and Charles Wesley, M.A.,
Student of Christ Church, Oxford. London. Printed by
William Strahan, and sold by James Hutton, bookseller,
at the Bible and Sun without Temple Bar;
Mr. Bray&rsquo;s, a brazier, in Little Britain, <span class="small">M DCC XXXIX</span>.&rsquo;
In this volume Charles Wesley&rsquo;s first published poems
appeared, and from this time he is the recognized poet
of the Revival.</p>
<p>Charles Wesley was born at Epworth Rectory on
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
December 18, 1707. Notwithstanding poverty, debt,
difficulty, and persecution, there was probably no more
truly Christian home in England. The cultivation of
personal religion and simple faith in God found congenial
soil here, and doubtless in other obscure country
parsonages. The Rector of Epworth was a poet of some
gifts, which the whole family inherited in greater or
less degree. His eldest son&mdash;sixteen years older than
Charles&mdash;was a minor poet and hymn-writer, and the
younger members of the family grew up in an atmosphere
which must have made it natural for them to
write verses.</p>
<p>We have, however, no indication of precocious
hymn-writing on the part of Charles Wesley, nor, indeed,
of any poetic composition till he was seven-and-twenty,
when he writes to convey a protest against his
sister&rsquo;s marriage. Probably he did not discover his
special talent till he was in Georgia, where the
Governor&rsquo;s wife wrote, &lsquo;Mr. Wesley has the gift of
verse, and has written many sweet hymns, which we
sing.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_109" href="#fn_109">[109]</a></p>
<p>But if Charles Wesley wrote little poetry before his
American mission, he had received much of the training
which was in due season to yield such abundant fruit.
The gracious influences of the Lincolnshire rectory, of
the Oxford Methodists, of his Moravian fellow passengers,
all helped to mould his fervent spirit. The
poet within him could not long be silent, and had
<span class="pb" id="Page_158">158</span>
already awoke when he received the baptism of the
Holy Spirit on the Day of Pentecost, 1738. This was
the time of his evangelical conversion, when he passed
out of the state of the anxious and conscientious servant
into the glorious liberty of the child of God. From
that time the word of Christ dwelt in him richly.
&lsquo;The wealth of God&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_110" href="#fn_110">[110]</a> was bestowed upon him, and
out of the abundance of a heart enriched by the indwelling
word he poured forth psalms, hymns, and
spiritual songs in an almost ceaseless stream. Had
Charles Wesley never passed through this experience
he would have been one of our greatest ecclesiastical
hymn-writers, and would have ranked with Heber and
Keble, but there would have been no distinctively
Methodist hymnody, and the Evangelical Revival would
have been immeasurably poorer. Moreover, he did
very much to preserve the standard of good taste, as
well as the fervour of religious feeling, in primitive
Methodism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Charles Wesley, a Christ Church student, came to add
sweetness to this sudden and startling light. He was the
&lsquo;sweet singer&rsquo; of the movement. His hymns expressed
the fiery conviction of its converts in lines so chaste and
beautiful, that its more extravagant features disappeared.
The wild throes of hysteric enthusiasm passed into a passion
for hymn-singing, and a new musical impulse was aroused
in the people which gradually changed the face of public
devotion throughout England.<a class="fn" id="fr_111" href="#fn_111">[111]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_159">159</div>
<p>Charles Wesley would probably have accepted
Keble&rsquo;s judgement as to the value of &lsquo;a sober standard
of feeling in matters of practical religion,&rsquo; but his
standard allowed a much wider range and warmer
glow to feeling than was possible to the poet of the
later Oxford Movement. Both the Wesleys shrank
with the instinct of the scholar and the gentleman
from extravagance and vulgarity. Their energies were
often devoted to restraining the exuberant manifestations
of the fervour of their converts; and though they
dared not deal too strictly with what they believed to
be indications of genuine spiritual emotion, they deprecated
undue excitement, and regarded hysterical testimonies
in a very different light from that in which
Edward Irving viewed the speaking with tongues.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Saved from the fear of hell and death,</p>
<p class="t">With joy we seek the things above;</p>
<p class="t0">And all Thy saints the spirit breathe</p>
<p class="t">Of power, sobriety, and love.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Pure love to God Thy members find,</p>
<p class="t">Pure love to every soul of man;</p>
<p class="t0">And in Thy sober, spotless mind,</p>
<p class="t">Saviour, our heaven on earth we gain.<a class="fn" id="fr_112" href="#fn_112">[112]</a></p>
</div>
<p>If Charles Wesley impressed himself upon the
Methodist Revival to its great benefit, the Revival in
its turn most advantageously affected his hymn-writing.
In many of his poems it is easy to trace the influence
of the Anglican Prayer-book or the Moravian prayer-meeting,
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
but the typically Methodist hymns show
little trace of either; they are songs of the open-air
service or of the class-room. Beecher&rsquo;s statement
that Charles Wesley&rsquo;s &lsquo;hymns are only Moravian hymns
re-sung&rsquo; is more than a gross exaggeration.</p>
<p>In the early days of Methodism, Charles Wesley
was as energetic and as successful an evangelist as
John. He loved the stir, the tumult, the triumph of
those great outdoor gatherings, where testimony must
be borne before mobs who might at any time endanger
the property and even the lives of preacher and hearers.
In this regard the poet of the Evangelical Revival had
a great advantage over the poet of the Tractarian Movement.
Keble is one of the singers of the country parsonage.
At Fairford and Hursley he found, as Cowper
at Olney,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The calm retreat, the silent shade,</p>
<p class="t0">With prayer and praise agree;</p>
</div>
<p>but Charles Wesley was moved to his highest flights
of praise by hard-won victories amongst his wild
hearers in Cornwall, or Moorfields, at Kingswood, or
Walsall. The depths of his soul were moved when he
saw the first signs of penitence in the unwonted tears
which cut white channels in the begrimed faces of the
colliers, whom he taught to sing</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But O the power of grace Divine!</p>
<p class="t">In hymns we now our voices raise,</p>
<p class="t0">Loudly in strange hosannas join,</p>
<p class="t">And blasphemies are turned to praise!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_161">161</div>
<p>Nor must we overlook the influence of the Methodist
class-meeting upon Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns. That
institution was of the essence of Methodism. It provided
a &lsquo;Holy Club,&rsquo; or a number of holy clubs, in
every place where converts had been gathered. True
to his mission as the poet of Methodism, he provided
hymns for the Societies in their private meetings as
well as in their vast evangelistic gatherings. The
hymn-book naturally begins with the section headed
&lsquo;Exhorting and Beseeching to Return to God,&rsquo; but the
majority of the hymns are for the penitent, the mourner,
the believer, and for the backslider&mdash;the man in whom
old habits have proved too strong, who has wandered
back to sin, but longs to turn to God again. Charles
Wesley shared with John the pastoral oversight of
the converts, often spending many weeks in Dublin,
Newcastle, or Bristol, or passing rapidly through
Cornwall or the Black Country, not only preaching
the gospel, but carefully examining, encouraging, and
sifting the societies. The class-meeting gave the distinctive
tone to Methodist devotion, and Charles Wesley
was quick to sympathize with the varying moods of
religious experience related by the members. His
hymns were often written for use by the Society in
its stated gatherings or by Christian friends meeting
socially in each other&rsquo;s houses. In every revision of
the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i> it has been recognized that
ample provision must be made for such occasions,
and that hymns might be very useful and, in
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
fact, extensively used though never heard in public
worship.</p>
<p>The Wesleys were singularly open to impressions
from those whom they met, or whose books they read.
Anglican, Moravian, Mystic by turns, they only gradually
developed into Methodists. In their first joint
publication they note that &lsquo;some verses ... were
wrote upon the scheme of the Mystic divines&rsquo; whom they
&lsquo;had once in great veneration, as the best explainers of
the gospel of Christ.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_113" href="#fn_113">[113]</a> George Herbert, John Norris (that
other less famous parson of Bemerton), Henry More,
and such German hymn-writers as Freylinghausen,
Christian Friedrich Richter, and W. C. Dessler, were
their first masters of Christian song; but Charles Wesley
soon found his own wings, and ceased to belong to any
school of poets, though to the end traces of other men&rsquo;s
writings are to be found&mdash;amounting occasionally to
actual verbal quotation, e.g. from Milton, Young, Tate
and Brady.</p>
<p>It is not possible to assign dates for the composition
of many of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns after the early
years of the Revival, except those called forth by some
special occasion, such as the &lsquo;Earthquake Hymns,&rsquo; and
those for the troubled days of the Insurrection of 1745.
At such times the hymns must have been written as
a kind of task-work, and the result is rarely more than
commonplace. The poet seemed to think it his duty,
as the laureate of Methodism, to provide suitable hymns
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
for the special services rendered necessary by stirring
events, and usually wrote one or two in each of the
favourite metres. These were issued in small pamphlets
at a few pence, and no doubt sold very extensively, as
did John Wesley&rsquo;s prose tracts, through which he &lsquo;unawares
became rich.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is difficult for a Methodist preacher of the fourth
generation, whose earliest and most sacred associations
are hallowed by memories of Wesley&rsquo;s hymns, to
attempt an impartial, not to say a critical, survey of
them. If, then, I seem to place too high an estimate
on the Wesley poetry as compared with the hymns
of others, I trust it may be credited rather to early
training and inherited affection than to denominational
partiality.</p>
<p>It may at once be granted that Charles Wesley
wrote far too easily and too diffusely to secure permanent
remembrance for the majority of his hymns.
Hundreds, perhaps thousands, might disappear without
serious loss to the spiritual and devotional life of the
Church. It may be admitted, further, that he did
not know which were his best and which his worst productions,
and that John Wesley&rsquo;s editing might with
advantage have been more severe. The printing-press
was dangerously convenient to Charles Wesley, and the
certainty of extensive sale for everything he published,
combined with the enthusiasm with which their people
received what the brothers wrote, either in prose or verse,
presented a temptation to rapid and frequent publication
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
which few poets could resist. Moreover, much that he
wrote was designed for immediate use, and had to be
written, printed, published ere the occasion passed. Yet
it is probable that not much would have been gained
by elaborate revision. Charles Wesley was too tender-hearted
to treat his literary offspring as David treated
the Moabites, measuring two lines to put to death
and one full line to keep alive, though both he and
Dr. Watts might not unwisely have adopted some
such heroic measure.</p>
<p>His hymns were often written at white heat, but
they underwent constant revision by their author, and
generally they had a further revision by his brother.
The poet himself records eight revisions of his Short
Hymns on the Gospels and Acts, which he noted were
&lsquo;finished April 24, 1765,&rsquo; and revised for the last time
May 11, 1787.</p>
<p>In his <i>Journal</i>, John Wesley records, under date
December 15, 1788&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This week I dedicated to the reading over my brother&rsquo;s
works. They are short poems on the Psalms, the four
Gospels, and the Acts of the Apostles. Some are bad; some
mean; some most excellently good; they give the true sense
of Scripture, always in good English, generally in good
verse; many of them are equal to most, if not to any, he
ever wrote; but some still savour of that poisonous mysticism
with which we were both not a little tainted before we
went to America.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Some bad, some mean, some most excellently good.&rsquo;
The judgement is just, though we who are accustomed
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
to our richer and more varied hymn-books should probably
place not a few in a fourth class&mdash;certainly not
&lsquo;bad&rsquo; or &lsquo;mean,&rsquo; yet hardly &lsquo;excellently good.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i> 429 hymns are attributed
to Charles Wesley; in the hymnals of other
Churches there are to be found a number which are
unknown in Methodism. It is safe to say that of
Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns about 500 are living still.</p>
<p>The first great service Wesley&rsquo;s hymns rendered to
Christian song was to raise the standard of feeling in
matters of practical religion. John Wesley&rsquo;s emendation
of a line of Doddridge&rsquo;s may illustrate the influence of
Methodist hymns upon religious emotion. Doddridge
wrote&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ye humble souls, that seek the Lord,</p>
<p class="t">Chase all your fears away;</p>
<p class="t0">And bow with pleasure down to see</p>
<p class="t">The place where Jesus lay.</p>
</div>
<p>Wesley changed &lsquo;pleasure&rsquo; into &lsquo;rapture&rsquo; in the hymn,
and Methodism raised Christian emotion from the
quiet satisfaction of Watts, Doddridge, and the elect
souls who kept alive the faith during the drab years
which preceded the Revival, to the ecstatic gladness of
those to whom that great movement brought the brightness
of a morning without clouds. The largest section
of the hymn-book was headed &lsquo;For Believers Rejoicing.&rsquo;
No other Christian poet ever sang such songs, for
no other has ever known the joy of the evangelist as
Charles Wesley knew it.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_166">166</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">In a rapture of joy</p>
<p class="t">My life I employ,</p>
<p class="t0">The God of my life to proclaim;</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis worth living for this,</p>
<p class="t">To administer bliss</p>
<p class="t0">And salvation in Jesus&rsquo;s name.</p>
</div>
<p>Joyousness was the natural result of the gospel he
preached. It was the good news of the assurance of
personal salvation. Here John Wesley&rsquo;s emendation of
one of Watts&rsquo;s famous hymns may serve as an illustration.
Watts wrote&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">My soul looks back to see</p>
<p class="t">The burdens Thou didst bear</p>
<p class="t0">When hanging on the curs&egrave;d tree,</p>
<p class="t">And <i>hopes</i> her guilt was there.</p>
</div>
<p>Wesley shows the difference between Methodism and
Calvinism by the change of a word&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And <i>knows</i> her guilt was there.</p>
</div>
<p>The Methodist doctrine of Assurance, the revival or
rediscovery of the doctrine of the Witness of the Spirit,
gave to Christian experience a confidence which was
more joyous than that of the &lsquo;elect.&rsquo; The Wesleys
never slurred the need of repentance&mdash;deep, poignant,
practical; but there is a great gulf between the comparatively
brief pangs of the Methodist penitent and
the habitual depression of the devout Romanist ever
searching through the dark places of the heart to find
matter for confession. The shades of the prison-house
did not linger long around the emancipated soul.
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
Coming out of the gloom into the sunshine the road
wound</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">Uphill all the way,</p>
<p class="t0">Yes, to the very end.</p>
</div>
<p>The redeemed of the Lord returned to Zion with singing,
with everlasting joy upon their heads. Notwithstanding
all that may be said, and, to some extent, with
justice, of the terrors, even the horrors, of early evangelical
preaching concerning death, hell, and judgement,
the Methodist hymns brought into Christian worship
a brighter and more trustful tone than it had known
for many generations. The Revival brought back the
golden days, the joy of heart, which characterized the
Apostolic Church, and the German Protestants at the
Reformation. At the time of the Revival the Church
of England, though largely Arminian in doctrine, was
so incapable of fervour, so afraid of zeal, that it had
practically no power over the masses, whilst by the
classes Christianity was, as Bishop Butler said, regarded
&lsquo;not so much as a subject of inquiry,&rsquo; but &lsquo;now at
length discovered to be fictitious.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In the Establishment there was hardly spiritual life
enough to put real vigour even into religious controversy.
Butler&rsquo;s <i>Analogy</i> is typical of the position of the ecclesiastical
leaders of that day. They were content if they
could demonstrate that the balance of probabilities was
in favour of Christianity, and did not even desire
to be anointed with the oil of gladness above their
fellows.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_168">168</div>
<p>The most earnest and aggressive of the Nonconformists
were stanchly Calvinistic, and, by their most
cherished beliefs, were precluded from the magnificent
visions of a redeemed world, which were at
once the inspiration and the attraction of Methodist
preaching.</p>
<p>Altogether outside theological controversy, and, for
the most part, uncared for by the religious people of the
day, lay the masses, ignorant, degraded, despised, who
neither gave, nor were expected to give, heed to things
higher than the needs of the &lsquo;mere animal.&rsquo; Of them
Charles Wesley only too truly said&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wild as the untaught Indian&rsquo;s brood</p>
<p class="t">The Christian savages remain.</p>
</div>
<p>The hymns &lsquo;Exhorting and Beseeching to Return to
God&rsquo; at once attracted the</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Poor outcasts of men, whose souls were despised</p>
<p class="t0">And left with disdain.</p>
</div>
<p>Very surely, though very slowly, the glad evangel
of the hymns which offer pardon and holiness and
heaven to all won its way in the Churches. It is
one of the most precious fruits of the Revival that now
hardly any Church can forbear to sing them. Nor is it
too much to say that Methodist hymns, even more than
Methodist teaching, broke down the Calvinistic idea
of the Church&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We are a garden walled around,</p>
<p class="t0">Chosen and made peculiar ground;</p>
<p class="t0">A little spot enclosed by grace</p>
<p class="t0">Out of the world&rsquo;s wide wilderness.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>Again, John Wesley&rsquo;s hymns gave a great impulse,
and added a great sanction, to the expression of personal
experience in hymns. They were unfettered by what
has been well described as the &lsquo;old traditions of reserved
and reticent worship.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_114" href="#fn_114">[114]</a> For good or ill, there is little
of reserve or reticence in Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What we have felt and seen</p>
<p class="t">With confidence we tell.</p>
</div>
<p>Many poets of the sanctuary have felt that the most
sacred experiences of the penitent sinner and of the
sanctified believer were not to be put into words, that
to utter them was to expose to the coarse breath of the
world what must perish in the very act of expression.
It was not without an effort that Charles Wesley broke
through this &lsquo;reserve;&rsquo; yet he did, and that not only from
a sense of duty, but from a conviction that to be silent
would be a cowardly yielding to the temptation to shun
the reproach of Christ.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And shall I slight my Father&rsquo;s love?</p>
<p class="t">Or basely fear His gifts to own?</p>
<p class="t0">Unmindful of His favours prove?</p>
<p class="t">Shall I, the hallowed cross to shun,</p>
<p class="t0">Refuse His righteousness to impart,</p>
<p class="t0">By hiding it within my heart?<a class="fn" id="fr_115" href="#fn_115">[115]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Moreover, many of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns&mdash;especially
the more personal&mdash;were intended to be sung &lsquo;secretly
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
among the faithful,&rsquo; rather than in the congregation.
They were written for the family gatherings of &lsquo;the
household of the faith,&rsquo; and thus were free from the
restraints which might be necessary in compositions
intended for larger and less sympathetic assemblies.</p>
<p>Wesley&rsquo;s hymns represented and, to a considerable
extent, created the specific Methodist type of
religious thought, emotion, and expression. They
were, also, the vehicle by which doctrine was conveyed
to the minds of the uneducated masses. The great
truths which it was the mission of Methodism to
teach are conspicuous in the Methodist hymns. Justification
by Faith, the Witness of the Spirit, Universal
Redemption, Entire Sanctification, are all taught in
Charles Wesley&rsquo;s remembered hymns as they are in
John Wesley&rsquo;s forgotten tracts. If the hymns have
ceased to be peculiarly Methodist, it is because
Christian experience and teaching have been so largely
influenced by them.</p>
<p>It is impossible not to compare Charles Wesley
with his great predecessor, Isaac Watts. The day
has gone by in which rival camps or choirs seek to
exalt the one by disparaging the other. As we have
seen, Watts&rsquo;s <i>Psalms and Hymns</i> were taken by the
Wesleys on their mission to Georgia, and it can never
be forgotten that, with his dying breath, John Wesley
quoted the hymn which, from those early days, had
been included in the hymn-books prepared by him
for congregational use.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_171">171</div>
<p>Watts was less careful of the technique of his
poetry than Charles Wesley. His rhymes are often
very bad, and occasionally are altogether forgotten,
and this is true of hymns whose intrinsic value is
such that they retain, and are likely to retain, their
place in our hymn-books. Charles Wesley is not
without sin in this regard, but a really bad rhyme is
comparatively rare in his best compositions. He has
less of poetic imagery than Watts, and has not so keen
an eye for the beauties of the natural world. Charles
Wesley never wrote a hymn that, in its own way, compares
with</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Eternal Wisdom! Thee we praise;</p>
</div>
<p>nor do I know any verse of his which equals in its
rich, strong monosyllables, Watts&rsquo;s</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">His every<a class="fn" id="fr_116" href="#fn_116">[116]</a> word of grace is strong</p>
<p class="t">As that which built the skies;</p>
<p class="t0">The voice that rolls the stars along</p>
<p class="t">Speaks all the promises.</p>
</div>
<p>Wesley was apt to use long and awkward words, sometimes
of his own coining, rarely adding to the force,
and always detracting from the practical value of the
hymn.</p>
<p>It must also be admitted that Charles Wesley
wrote some verses the taste of which is dreadful,
though he never approaches the execrable coarseness of
some Moravian hymns, or of the lines which Walter
Shirley transfigured into &lsquo;Sweet the moments rich in
<span class="pb" id="Page_172">172</span>
blessing.&rsquo; Both Watts and Wesley had a quiet rather
than a keen sense of humour, but they had little of
that appreciation of the comic which is so acute in
our own time.<a class="fn" id="fr_117" href="#fn_117">[117]</a></p>
<p>Charles Wesley rarely, if ever, reaches the depth
of prosaic commonplace which marks many of Watts&rsquo;s
hymns. He had a more sensitive ear and a more
cultivated taste, and, what is perhaps more to the
point, he had a faithful, though affectionate and
admiring, critic in his brother. When John Wesley
said of Charles that his least praise was his talent for
poetry, he meant, not to disparage his hymns, but to
bear the highest testimony possible to the gifts and
graces of his mind and character.</p>
<p>In considering somewhat in detail the hymns of
Charles Wesley, it is convenient to treat of them in
the classes into which they may be broadly divided.
But even so it is obviously impossible to glance at more
than a small number of his poems.</p>
<h4>1.&mdash;<span class="sc">Hymns of the Christian Year</span></h4>
<p>The idea of an elaborate classification according
to the Church seasons, so usual in modern Anglican
hymnals, had not yet become popular. Bishop Ken&rsquo;s
<span class="pb" id="Page_173">173</span>
<i>Hymns for all the Festivals of the Year</i><a class="fn" id="fr_118" href="#fn_118">[118]</a> (published
in 1721, ten years after his death), the precursor
and, to some extent, the inspiration of the <i>Christian
Year</i>, was not intended for use as a hymn-book.
Wither&rsquo;s <i>Hymns and Songs of the Church</i> (1623)
provided for all the chief festivals, saints&rsquo; days, and
other occasional services. About forty years later
(1661) Dr. Eaton, Vicar of Bishop&rsquo;s Castle, Salop, published
<i>The Holy Calendar</i>, but his poems were not
intended to be sung. The Wesleys issued a number
of pamphlets containing hymns for the great festivals,
and it would not be difficult to select from their various
publications a &lsquo;Christian year,&rsquo; in which every hymn was
suitable for public worship. But the pieces would need
to be gathered, for the brothers did not contemplate the
use of their hymn-books in Church services; they were
designed for the preaching-house, the open-air service,
and the class-meeting. The Nonconformist Churches
had adopted the custom early in the century, but in
the Church of England hymn-singing was still, and for
many years after, an irregularity, if not an offence.</p>
<p>First and greatest of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s festival
hymns is the Christmas carol</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hark! how all the welkin rings,</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Glory to the King of kings.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<p>It was published in 1739, and is not impossibly one
of the &lsquo;many sweet hymns&rsquo; which were sung in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
household of General Oglethorpe. Whitefield made
some popular alterations, and included it in his
<i>Collection</i>, in 1753. In 1782 it found a place in the
Prayer-book, after the new version of the Psalms. It
was omitted from Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Collection</i>, but was inserted
in the supplement of 1830&mdash;nearly a century after its
composition.</p>
<p>In the same metre, and not inferior, are the hymns
for Easter&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Christ, the Lord, is risen to-day,&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Sons of men and angels say!</p>
</div>
<p>and for Ascension Day&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Hail the day that sees Him rise,</p>
<p class="t0">Ravished from our wishful eyes.</p>
</div>
<p>There are some good verses in the Whit Sunday
hymn&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Granted is the Saviour&rsquo;s prayer,</p>
<p class="t0">Sent the gracious Comforter;</p>
</div>
<p>and in the little-known hymn for the Epiphany&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sons of men, behold from far,</p>
<p class="t0">Hail the long-expected Star!<a class="fn" id="fr_119" href="#fn_119">[119]</a></p>
</div>
<p>but they are not equal to the others.</p>
<p>Of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns on our Lord&rsquo;s Passion,
the finest are those beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With glorious clouds encompassed round,</p>
<p class="t">Whom angels dimly see,</p>
<p class="t0">Will the Unsearchable be found,</p>
<p class="t">Or God appear to me?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc"><span class="gs">. . . . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_175">175</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Love divine! what hast thou done!</p>
<p class="t">The immortal God hath died for me</p>
<p class="t0">The Father&rsquo;s co-eternal Son</p>
<p class="t">Bore all my sins upon the tree;</p>
<p class="t0">The immortal God for me hath died!</p>
<p class="t0">My Lord, my Love is crucified.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc"><span class="gs">. . . . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Thou who hast our sorrows borne,</p>
<p class="t0">Help us to look on Thee and mourn,</p>
<p class="t">On Thee Whom we have slain,</p>
<p class="t0">Have pierced a thousand thousand times,</p>
<p class="t0">And by reiterated crimes</p>
<p class="t">Renewed Thy mortal pain.<a class="fn" id="fr_120" href="#fn_120">[120]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The popular hymn beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t3">All ye that pass by,</p>
<p class="t3">To Jesus draw nigh:</p>
<p class="t0">To you is it nothing that Jesus should die?</p>
</div>
<p>is, owing to its cheerful metre, hardly suited to the
solemn services of Good Friday, and was intended for
the open air. It was headed &lsquo;Invitation to Sinners,&rsquo;
and was used by Whitefield with great effect when
preaching at the Market Cross, Nottingham, and elsewhere.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>
<p>John Wesley appointed many fast days, and was
careful to fix them on Friday, but the observance of
Lent does not seem to have been enforced, or even
strongly recommended, in the Methodist Society.
Hymns for saints&rsquo; days and for the minor festivals
are unknown to the Wesley poetry.</p>
<h4>2. <span class="sc">Hymns on the Lord&rsquo;s Supper.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_121" href="#fn_121">[121]</a></h4>
<p>This pamphlet contains 166 hymns, many of which
are admirable and very close paraphrases of passages in
Brevint&rsquo;s <i>Christian Sacrifice</i>, but others are independent
of that devout treatise. Many lend themselves readily
to use in &lsquo;catholic&rsquo; services, and have often been
quoted as indicating high sacramentarian views.<a class="fn" id="fr_122" href="#fn_122">[122]</a></p>
<p>On the other hand, such verses as the following must be
taken in an entirely evangelical sense&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The cup of blessing, blessed by Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Let it Thy blood impart:</p>
<p class="t0">The bread Thy mystic body be,</p>
<p class="t">And cheer each languid heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc"><span class="gs">. . . . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With solemn faith we offer up,</p>
<p class="t">And spread before Thy glorious eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">That only ground of all our hope,</p>
<p class="t">That precious, bleeding Sacrifice,</p>
<p class="t0">Which brings Thy grace on sinners down,</p>
<p class="t0">And perfects all our souls in one.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc"><span class="gs">. . . . .</span></p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">By faith we see Thy sufferings past</p>
<p class="t">In this mysterious rite brought back:</p>
<p class="t0">And on Thy grand oblation cast,</p>
<p class="t">Its saving benefits partake.</p>
</div>
<p>In these paraphrases there are naturally expressions
which represent Brevint and not the Wesleys, except
in so far as they indicate a general approval of his
teaching. The hymns which most closely follow the
treatise are often the least happy. Yet, when every
deduction is made, this little book is one of the most
edifying of devotional preparations for the Communion.</p>
<p>These hymns have had a permanent influence upon
Methodist worship. Many of them were probably
suggested by the Order of Administration in the Book
of Common Prayer, the most beautiful of all the
Anglican services. Both the brothers had a profound
reverence for the Holy Communion, as the supreme act
of Christian worship, and constantly impressed upon
Methodists the duty of its regular observance. Never
at any time was there a danger of the Methodist
Societies cutting themselves off from the Catholic
Church by neglect of the Sacraments, or of their
becoming an exclusively evangelistic organization on
the plan of the Salvation Army. This pamphlet, of
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
which many editions were issued during the lifetime
of John Wesley, shows how serious a view they desired
their people to take of the value of this sacrament,
whilst its great popularity suggests that the intelligence
of the Methodists of a hundred and fifty years ago was
very much above that with which we are accustomed
to credit them. The republication of Brevint&rsquo;s <i>Treatise</i>,
in a small series of devotional manuals, edited by
Dr. George Osborn, did not revive interest in it, as
it might have done had a judicious selection from the
hymns been included.<a class="fn" id="fr_123" href="#fn_123">[123]</a></p>
<p>Several hymns familiar to us in other sections of
our hymn-books were written for, or included in, this
series. The prayer for the Church militant, with its
remembrance of and thanksgiving for those in trouble
and for those who have &lsquo;departed this life in Thy faith
and fear,&rsquo; probably suggested the hymn&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">What are these arrayed in white?</p>
</div>
<p>whilst the <i>Ter-Sanctus</i> is the inspiration of&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lift your eyes of faith and see</p>
<p class="t0">Saints and angels joined in one.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_179">179</div>
<p>The thought of communion with the Church triumphant
was very precious to Charles Wesley, and there is a
most beautiful and solemn appropriateness in the
lifting of the eyes as well as of the heart, when, having
claimed in faith the forgiveness of sins, we take our
unchallenged place at the table of the Lord. The Holy
Communion includes fellowship with those who have
&lsquo;crossed the flood&rsquo; and are for ever with the Lord.</p>
<p>Nor is the other aspect of the communion of saints
forgotten. It is often easier for earnest souls to claim
fellowship with the white-robed company of heaven
than with those on earth who are divided from them by
divergencies of doctrine and practice. But if, on the
one hand, the Eucharist has been a stone of stumbling
and a rock of offence to theologians and ecclesiastics,
on the other it is the bond of union between all &lsquo;holding
fast the Head.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_124" href="#fn_124">[124]</a> The true evangelic and the typically
Wesleyan position is well stated in the verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Part of His Church below,</p>
<p class="t">We thus our right maintain;</p>
<p class="t0">Our living membership we show,</p>
<p class="t">And in the fold remain,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">The sheep of Israel&rsquo;s fold,</p>
<p class="t">In England&rsquo;s pastures fed;</p>
<p class="t0">And fellowship with all we hold,</p>
<p class="t">Who hold it with our Head.<a class="fn" id="fr_125" href="#fn_125">[125]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This is the attitude our Church has consistently
adopted. We do not claim exclusive privileges or
profess that our boundaries are the walls of that city
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
of God which lieth four square. We are but &lsquo;part of
His Church below,&rsquo; but we <i>are</i> a part, and in obedience
to our dying Lord&rsquo;s command &lsquo;we thus our right
maintain.&rsquo; What matter though some deny the
validity of our &lsquo;orders,&rsquo; the efficacy of our sacraments,
our title to a place in the Holy Catholic Church?
They may drive us from their local altars, but they
cannot exclude us from the Lord&rsquo;s table. They may
deny us a place in that family for which our blessed
Lord was content to be betrayed into the hands of
sinful men. What then? We do not deny theirs.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fellowship with all we hold,</p>
<p class="t0">Who hold it with our Head.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a note too seldom heard in Communion
hymns. I do not remember to have found it so
clearly put anywhere else, though Major Turton&rsquo;s
prayer for unity comes graciously near to it.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">For all Thy Church, O Lord, we intercede;</p>
<p class="t">Make Thou our sad divisions soon to cease;</p>
<p class="t0">Draw us the nearer each to each, we plead,</p>
<p class="t">By drawing all to Thee, O Prince of Peace;</p>
<p class="t0">Thus may we all one Bread, one Body be,</p>
<p class="t0">Through this blest Sacrament of Unity.<a class="fn" id="fr_126" href="#fn_126">[126]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The <i>sacramental</i> character of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper as
the sign and pledge of the believer&rsquo;s consecration to
the service of Christ is represented in the hymn
beginning&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_181">181</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Father, Son, and Holy Ghost,</p>
<p class="t">One in Three, and Three in One,</p>
<p class="t0">As by the celestial host,</p>
<p class="t">Let Thy will on earth be done;</p>
<p class="t0">Praise by all to Thee be given,</p>
<p class="t0">Glorious Lord of earth and heaven.</p>
</div>
<p>which in some of its verses suggests the prayer known
as the First Thanksgiving,<a class="fn" id="fr_127" href="#fn_127">[127]</a> though it is based upon a
beautiful paragraph of Brevint&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>A few hymns under the heading &lsquo;After the Sacrament&rsquo;
form an unimportant supplement, but the long
series really ends with a joyous song well-suited to be
the happy close of the solemn commemoration of the
sacrifice of Calvary and the renewal of the Christian&rsquo;s
oath of allegiance</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let Him to whom we now belong</p>
<p class="t">His sovereign right assert,</p>
<p class="t0">And take up every thankful song</p>
<p class="t">And every loving heart.</p>
</div>
<p>This final note of glad thanksgiving reminds us that in
our Communion Service the &lsquo;Gloria in Excelsis&rsquo; immediately
precedes the Benediction.<a class="fn" id="fr_128" href="#fn_128">[128]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_182">182</div>
<h4>3. <span class="sc">Hymns of the Calvinistic Controversy.</span></h4>
<p>From these Communion hymns we pass to a
series of a very different type. The story of the
Calvinistic controversy&mdash;which seemed to show that
a theological fountain could at the same time send forth
sweet water and bitter&mdash;belongs to Church history, not
to hymnology. Yet we cannot pass it over, for none of
the hymns of the Wesleys <i>meant</i> so much as those
which proclaimed the glad tidings of a free and full
salvation. The controversy was civil war, a strife
among brethren, and it is good to know that the love
of Whitefield and the Wesleys was able to bear, though
not without terrible strain, even this sore trial. From
that great controversy we inherit the true eirenicon,
the agreeing to differ, which is the best possible
solution of many religious disputes. Whitefield and
the Wesleys finally agreed to differ and continued to
love. But for a time there was &lsquo;a sharp contention
so that they parted asunder one from the other.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1740 John Wesley published, after some hesitation,
his sermon on &lsquo;Free Grace,&rsquo; and added a long, dull
hymn by his brother on &lsquo;Universal Redemption.&rsquo; In
the same year the brothers issued a second series of
<i>Hymns and Sacred Poems</i>, which contained this and
other pieces, setting forth in the most emphatic terms
the Arminian doctrine, and condemning in even more
emphatic terms all who believed in what Calvin had
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
called &lsquo;<i>decretum horribile</i>.&rsquo; Whitefield was shocked by
the Wesleyan doctrine itself, and was beyond measure
distressed by what he saw must lead to a breach
between himself and his dearest friends. His love and
sorrow come out most attractively in his letters.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;My dear, dear Brethren,&rsquo; he wrote, &lsquo;why did you
throw out the bone of contention? Why did you print
that sermon against predestination? Why did you, in
particular, my dear brother Charles, affix your hymn and
join in putting out your late hymn-book?&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_129" href="#fn_129">[129]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>John Wesley&rsquo;s sermon carefully avoided reference
to his friend. Whitefield, however, felt in honour
bound to state his own views and to &lsquo;answer&rsquo; Wesley&rsquo;s
sermon. To this reply he added a poor poem by Dr.
Watts, which was intended to balance Charles Wesley&rsquo;s
hymn. Here are two of Watts&rsquo;s verses&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Behold the potter and the clay,</p>
<p class="t">He forms His vessels as he please;</p>
<p class="t0">Such is our God, and such are we,</p>
<p class="t">The subjects of His high decrees.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">May not the sovereign Lord on high,</p>
<p class="t">Dispense His favours as He will;</p>
<p class="t0">Choose some to life while others die,</p>
<p class="t">And yet be just and gracious still?</p>
</div>
<p>After this the battle became fast and furious. The two
pamphlets of <i>Hymns on God&rsquo;s Everlasting Love</i><a class="fn" id="fr_130" href="#fn_130">[130]</a> were
issued in 1741, and Whitefield was in despair. He
<span class="pb" id="Page_184">184</span>
writes: &lsquo;Dear brother Charles is more and more rash.
He has lately printed some very bad hymns.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_131" href="#fn_131">[131]</a> From
Whitefield&rsquo;s point of view they were undoubtedly very
bad, and even justify his charge that the Wesleys
&lsquo;dressed up&rsquo; the doctrine of election in &lsquo;horrible colours.&rsquo;
On the other hand, these hymns contain some of the
finest specimens of evangelic hymn-writing to be found
in the Wesley poetry.</p>
<p>They may be readily divided into two classes, the
one vigorous and often bitterly satirical onslaughts
upon the Calvinistic position, which are more in the
style of &lsquo;Holy Willie&rsquo;s Prayer&rsquo; than in that of &lsquo;Jesu,
Lover of my soul,&rsquo; the other containing the proclamation
of the glad tidings of universal redemption. Both
elements are often found in the same composition.
This is true of the first of the hymns, a portion of
which has been used in Methodist congregations for
more than a century and a half, and retains its place in
the new hymn-book. I print some verses with the
original italics, indicating its polemic purpose.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Father, <i>whose everlasting love</i></p>
<p class="t">Thy only Son for sinners gave;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose grace to <i>all</i> did <i>freely</i> move,</p>
<p class="t">And sent Him down a <i>world to save</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Help us Thy mercy to extol</p>
<p class="t">Immense, unfathomed, unconfined;</p>
<p class="t0">To praise the Lamb who <i>died for all</i>,</p>
<p class="t">The <i>general Saviour of mankind</i>.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_185">185</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy <i>undistinguishing regard</i></p>
<p class="t">Was cast on <i>Adam&rsquo;s</i> fallen race:</p>
<p class="t0">For all Thou hast in Christ prepared,</p>
<p class="t"><i>Sufficient, sovereign, saving</i> grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus hath said, we <i>all</i> shall hope,</p>
<p class="t">Preventing grace for all is free:</p>
<p class="t0">And I, if I be lifted up,</p>
<p class="t">I will <i>draw all men</i> unto Me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Arise, O God, maintain Thy cause!</p>
<p class="t">The fulness of the <i>Gentiles</i> call:</p>
<p class="t0">Lift up the standard of Thy cross</p>
<p class="t">And <i>all</i> shall own Thou diedst for all.<a class="fn" id="fr_132" href="#fn_132">[132]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In other hymns he employs the most biting, taunting
sarcasm. It is difficult to suppose that these were
ever sung even in the thickest of the fight; but they
were sown broadcast (price fourpence), and were, no
doubt, read with ecstatic delight by those who were
on the Wesleys&rsquo; side in the great controversy. It is
easy at this distance of time and circumstance to condemn
the vehemence of the language used on both sides,
especially in the later and more acrimonious stages of
the controversy. But this was one of &lsquo;freedom&rsquo;s battles.&rsquo;
It was magnificent, and it was war. To the Wesleys
the doctrine that by the arbitrary decree of God&mdash;the
God of love!&mdash;children were born to a doom which
they could neither escape nor deserve was hateful,
blasphemous, impossible. If <i>this</i> were indeed the truth
of God, what gospel was there to preach? Let us eat
and drink, for to-morrow we die and meet the inevitable
<span class="pb" id="Page_186">186</span>
doom. Nor could they tolerate what seemed to them
the smug satisfaction of &lsquo;the elect,&rsquo; to whose certainty
of salvation the equal certainty of the damnation of the
reprobate added a pleasing flavour. They would not
accept salvation on such terms. &lsquo;Take back,&rsquo; Charles
Wesley cries indignantly,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Take back my interest in Thy blood,</p>
<p class="t0">Unless it streamed for all the race.</p>
</div>
<p>With a true controversial instinct, the Wesleys
fastened upon Calvin&rsquo;s phrase &lsquo;<i>decretum horribile</i>,&rsquo; and,
preferring to transliterate rather than to translate,
turned again and again to rend it.</p>
<p>A poem describing the possibilities of evil in the
human heart and mind comes to a climax thus&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I could the devil&rsquo;s law receive,</p>
<p class="t">Unless restrained by Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">I could (good God!) I could believe</p>
<p class="t">The Horrible Decree.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I could believe that God is hate&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">The God of love and grace</p>
<p class="t0">Did damn, pass by, and reprobate</p>
<p class="t">The most of human race.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Farther than this I cannot go,</p>
<p class="t">Till Tophet take me in.</p>
<p class="t0">But, O, forbid that I should know</p>
<p class="t">This mystery of sin.<a class="fn" id="fr_133" href="#fn_133">[133]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Such were the amenities of religious controversy in the
eighteenth century!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_187">187</div>
<p>Again, in a lighter but still intensely earnest vein,
he caricatures his adversaries&rsquo; teaching&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The righteous God consigned</p>
<p class="t">Them over to their doom,</p>
<p class="t0">And sent the Saviour of mankind</p>
<p class="t">To damn them from the womb:</p>
<p class="t0">To damn for falling short</p>
<p class="t">Of what they could not do,</p>
<p class="t0">For not believing the report</p>
<p class="t">Of that which was not true.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He did not do the deed&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">(Some have more mildly raved),</p>
<p class="t0">He did not damn them, but decreed</p>
<p class="t">They never should be saved.</p>
</div>
<p>This effusion ends in a higher strain, with a dedication
of his own life to the proclamation of universal
redemption&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My life I here present,</p>
<p class="t">My heart&rsquo;s last drop of blood;</p>
<p class="t0">O let it all be freely spent</p>
<p class="t">In proof that Thou art good:</p>
<p class="t0">Art good to all that breathe,</p>
<p class="t">Who all may pardon have:</p>
<p class="t0">Thou willest not the sinner&rsquo;s death,</p>
<p class="t">But all the world <i>wouldst</i> save.</p>
</div>
<p>John Wesley tried in his brief tract on the <i>Calvinistic
Controversy</i><a class="fn" id="fr_134" href="#fn_134">[134]</a> (1743) to make peace with Whitefield,
and some of his concessions are surprising&mdash;indeed,
he afterwards retracted them. But Charles, who at
this time was in the full glow of his early evangelistic
<span class="pb" id="Page_188">188</span>
triumphs, and who was much less of a theologian than
his brother, felt that he was engaged in a holy crusade.
He tried to write calmly, he prayed for grace to speak
tenderly of those who were erring from the truth he
held so dear, but&mdash;well, he could not keep silence.</p>
<p>In one of these hymns&mdash;a portion of which remains
in the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i>&mdash;he prays&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O arm me with the mind,</p>
<p class="t">Meek Lamb! that was in Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">And let my knowing zeal be joined</p>
<p class="t">To fervent charity.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With calm and tempered zeal</p>
<p class="t">Let me enforce Thy call,</p>
<p class="t0">And vindicate Thy gracious will,</p>
<p class="t">Which offers life to all.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou dost not stand in need</p>
<p class="t">Of me to prop Thy cause,</p>
<p class="t0">To assert Thy general grace, or spread</p>
<p class="t">The victory of Thy cross.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O may I love like Thee!</p>
<p class="t">And in Thy footsteps tread!</p>
<p class="t0">Thou hatest all iniquity,</p>
<p class="t">But nothing Thou hast made.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O may I learn Thy art,</p>
<p class="t">With meekness to reprove;</p>
<p class="t0">To hate the sin with all my heart,</p>
<p class="t">But still the sinner love.<a class="fn" id="fr_135" href="#fn_135">[135]</a></p>
</div>
<p>These verses might be headed &lsquo;A Prayer before Controversy,&rsquo;
but it is a shock to the reader on turning the
page to find that the next verse shows how soon he
descended from this high level.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_189">189</div>
<p>The controversy was renewed thirty years later with
vastly greater bitterness, and with much more personal
feeling.</p>
<p>John Fletcher parted in 1771 from his Trevecca
students like the saint he was, for he could no longer
hold his place when other Arminians were discharged.
&lsquo;I cannot give up the possibility of the salvation of all
any more than I can give up the truth and love of God....
I left them all in peace, the servant, but no more
the president of the college.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_136" href="#fn_136">[136]</a></p>
<p>The love of Whitefield and the Wesleys was of the
kind which many waters cannot quench; but when
Madan, Romaine, Hervey, and Rowland Hill heaped
upon John Wesley&rsquo;s venerable head torrents of vulgar
abuse&mdash;abuse absolutely impossible, inconceivable in
our milder mannered age<a class="fn" id="fr_137" href="#fn_137">[137]</a>&mdash;Charles felt that there was
a point beyond which even Christian charity could not
decently go. His refusal to write Hervey&rsquo;s epitaph is
worthy of a Christian gentleman:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let Madan or Romaine record his praise,</p>
<p class="t0">Enough that Wesley&rsquo;s brother can forgive.</p>
</div>
<p>The flowing tide, however, was with the Methodists,
and though the fight was long, and the victory was not
wholly won in their day, these hymns rendered an
inestimable service to the cause of religious freedom.
It may be true that they represented Calvin&rsquo;s teaching
one-sidedly, and at times misrepresented it, but it
<span class="pb" id="Page_190">190</span>
cannot be denied that they pictured current Calvinistic
teaching accurately enough. The Wesleys saw clearly
that, should belief in a limited redemption spread in
their Society, they would but labour in vain and spend
their strength for nought. They might have gathered
little coteries of devout folk, strongly tinctured with
what we now call Plymouth Brethrenism, but they
could never have founded a great Church, whose chiefest
glory should be its missionary enterprise both at home
and in the ends of the earth. The mission of Thomas
Coke more than a hundred years ago, the great city
missions of our own time, the work of William Booth,
of Hugh Price Hughes, and Samuel F. Collier, would
have been impossible had they not been able to say
anywhere and to all&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sent by my Lord, on you I call;</p>
<p class="t0">The invitation is to all:</p>
<p class="t0">Come, all the world; come, sinner, thou;</p>
<p class="t0">All things in Christ are ready now!</p>
</div>
<p>The Wesleys reached their doctrine of general
redemption by two paths. In the first place, they had
been trained in the school of Arminius and of Laud,
and had been confirmed in the faith by their own careful
study of God&rsquo;s word. But it is abundantly evident
that their own experience had led them to believe in
the infinite mercy of God. Charles Wesley, especially,
argued with the profound humility of the sincere penitent,
that his own salvation, of which he had received
the undeniable assurance, &lsquo;the indubitable seal,&rsquo; on
<span class="pb" id="Page_191">191</span>
Whit-Sunday, 1738, was itself convincing evidence of
the good tidings he proclaimed.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy sovereign grace to all extends,</p>
<p class="t">Immense and unconfined:</p>
<p class="t0">From age to age it never ends;</p>
<p class="t">It reaches all mankind.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Throughout the world its breadth is known,</p>
<p class="t">Wide as infinity;</p>
<p class="t0">So wide, it never passed by one,</p>
<p class="t">Or it had passed by me.<a class="fn" id="fr_138" href="#fn_138">[138]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This is a note which constantly recurs in the <i>Hymns
on God&rsquo;s Everlasting Love</i>&mdash;sometimes expressed quaintly
and unpoetically, sometimes with a pathos truly sublime,
as in these verses&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let me kiss Thy bleeding feet,</p>
<p class="t">And bathe and wash them with my tears;</p>
<p class="t0">The story of Thy love repeat</p>
<p class="t">In every drooping sinner&rsquo;s ears,</p>
<p class="t0">That all may hear the quickening sound,</p>
<p class="t0">Since I, even I, have mercy found.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let Thy love my heart constrain,</p>
<p class="t">Thy love for every sinner free;</p>
<p class="t0">That every fallen soul of man</p>
<p class="t">May taste the grace that found out me;</p>
<p class="t0">That all mankind, with me, may prove</p>
<p class="t0">Thy sovereign, everlasting love.<a class="fn" id="fr_139" href="#fn_139">[139]</a></p>
</div>
<p>In this, as in other respects, the Wesleyan theology
was characteristically Pauline. &lsquo;This is a faithful
saying, and worthy of all men to be received that
Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, of
whom I am the chief.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>Hymns of this class have an important place in
the story of the Methodist Revival, as well as in the
Calvinistic controversy. The vehemence, the violence,
with which the Wesleys asserted their doctrine was
largely, if not entirely, due to their sense of what it
meant to the vast crowds of neglected, ignorant, savage
folk who listened with amazement to the messengers
who proclaimed God&rsquo;s love to them.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sinners, believe the gospel word,</p>
<p class="t">Jesus is come your souls to save!</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus is come, your common Lord;</p>
<p class="t">Pardon ye all in Him may have,</p>
<p class="t0">May now be saved, whoever will;</p>
<p class="t0">This Man receiveth sinners still.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See where the lame, the halt, the blind.</p>
<p class="t">The deaf, the dumb, the sick, the poor,</p>
<p class="t0">Flock to the Friend of human kind,</p>
<p class="t">And freely all accept their cure;</p>
<p class="t0">To whom doth He His help deny?</p>
<p class="t0">Whom in His days of flesh pass by?<a class="fn" id="fr_140" href="#fn_140">[140]</a></p>
</div>
<p>And again&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O unexampled Love,</p>
<p class="t">O all-redeeming Grace!</p>
<p class="t0">How freely didst Thou move</p>
<p class="t">To save a fallen race!</p>
<p class="t0">What shall I do to make it known</p>
<p class="t0">What Thou for all mankind hast done?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O for a trumpet voice,</p>
<p class="t">On all the world to call!</p>
<p class="t0">To bid their hearts rejoice</p>
<p class="t">In Him who died for all;</p>
<p class="t0">For all my Lord was crucified,</p>
<p class="t0">For all, for all my Saviour died!<a class="fn" id="fr_141" href="#fn_141">[141]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_193">193</div>
<p>This was a new voice crying in the wilderness of
dull religious mediocrity or of self-satisfied religious
devotion, it was the clarion-cry of one that brought
good tidings to the outcasts of Israel.</p>
<h4>4. <span class="sc">Hymns of the Methodist Evangel</span></h4>
<p>From the first the Methodists made their own
experience the starting-point of their preaching. John
Wesley desired no help from any who had not &lsquo;the
witness in himself.&rsquo; His itinerants must set to their
seal that God is true. &lsquo;We are witnesses of these
things, and so is also the Holy Ghost.&rsquo; This personal
element, the testimony of the man who believed and
therefore spoke, differentiated at once Methodist
preaching from the cold impersonal moral essays
of the parish church. But Methodist preaching would
not have been what it was had John Wesley&rsquo;s
sermons rather than Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns represented
Methodism to the masses. John Wesley&rsquo;s keen
intellect held his deep religious fervour in check, but
Charles took full advantage of the poet&rsquo;s licence to
say what was in his heart without reserve and without
modifying explanations.</p>
<p>His hymns of invitation strike a new note. There
is nothing to compare with them in earlier hymn-writers,
and comparatively little in later. They are
the battle-songs of an open-air preacher, and are
borne on the wings of the tempest that raged around
<span class="pb" id="Page_194">194</span>
the heroic little poet as he faced cheerily the rage or
ridicule of the mob. His metres are bright and lilting,
winning the ear of the simple and arresting the
casual passer-by.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The mercy I feel To others I show,</p>
<p class="t0">I set to my seal That Jesus is true:</p>
<p class="t0">Ye all may find favour Who come at His call,</p>
<p class="t0">O come to my Saviour, His grace is for all!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O let me commend My Saviour to you,</p>
<p class="t0">The publican&rsquo;s Friend And Advocate too,</p>
<p class="t0">For you He is pleading His merits and death,</p>
<p class="t0">With God interceding For sinners beneath.</p>
</div>
<p>And again&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O all that pass by, To Jesus draw near;</p>
<p class="t0">He utters a cry, Ye sinners, give ear!</p>
<p class="t0">From hell to retrieve you, He spreads out His hands;</p>
<p class="t0">Now, now to receive you, He graciously stands.</p>
</div>
<p>Only a preacher, perhaps only an open-air preacher,
could have written such hymns. They are not hymns
of the oratory, of the class-room, or the village church;
but of that vast cathedral whose roof is the blue
vault of heaven; they are songs of Moorfields, of
Kingswood, of Newcastle, and of Gwennap. Perhaps
of all Wesley&rsquo;s hymns these are the most characteristically
Methodist. Comparatively few are to be found
even yet in any but Methodist books, but in them
they hold an unchallenged place, and belong to the
whole Methodist family, which has had many a
quarrel in Conference, has been many a time by
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
schisms rent asunder, but has never faltered in its
loyal and steadfast proclamation of the message of
God&rsquo;s everlasting love.</p>
<p>As a general rule each revision of a Nonconformist
hymn-book renders it less distinctive of the denomination
it represents, and this is, to some extent, true
of the new Methodist hymn-book. It has lost the
section with which Wesley&rsquo;s book opened, &lsquo;Exhorting
and Entreating to Return to God,&rsquo; but it retains
almost all the hymns. Modern writers have seldom
succeeded in hymns of this type. A few, however,
rank with the best of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s, who himself
never struck a note of yearning sympathy for the
erring more true and tender than Faber in his &lsquo;Come
to Jesus.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Souls of men! why will ye scatter</p>
<p class="t">Like a crowd of frightened sheep?</p>
<p class="t0">Foolish hearts! why will ye wander</p>
<p class="t">From a love so true and deep?</p>
</div>
<p>It is not one of the best signs of the times that
hymns of invitation are now for the most part provided
by American singers and are of the ephemeral
class.</p>
<p>Faber&rsquo;s exquisite lines, set side by side with such
a hymn as Wesley&rsquo;s</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ye neighbours and friends Of Jesus, draw near,</p>
</div>
<p>well illustrate the difference between the cheery,
hopeful, out-door evangel of the Wesleys and the
subdued earnestness of the pleading of the modern
<span class="pb" id="Page_196">196</span>
Catholic or Anglo-Catholic missioner. I do not suggest
that the comparison is to the advantage or disadvantage
of either, but only indicate the difference
of the tone of the mid-eighteenth and mid-nineteenth
century mission hymns. In our day evangelism has
lost much of its novelty, and men are less hopeful
than they were of the world&rsquo;s conversion. To the first
Methodists it seemed as though any triumph was
possible to such a gospel as theirs, and their battle-songs
were all songs of victory.</p>
<p>Wesley&rsquo;s hymns enshrine the history as well as the
doctrines of Methodism, and few studies in Methodist
hymnology are more interesting than that of the
geography of the hymn-book. As to the local setting
of &lsquo;Lo! on a narrow neck of land&rsquo; there has been
much controversy, but it undoubtedly belongs to
Jekyl Island, and not to the Land&rsquo;s End. Charles
Wesley wrote to Lady Oglethorpe from Jekyl Island
in 1736&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&lsquo;Last evening I wandered to the north end of the island,
and stood upon the narrow point which your ladyship will
recall as there projecting into the ocean. The vastness of
the watery waste, as compared with my standing place,
called to mind the briefness of human life and the immensity
of its consequences, and my surroundings inspired
me to write the enclosed hymn, beginning</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lo! on a narrow neck of land,</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Twixt two unbounded seas I stand&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>which, I trust, may pleasure your ladyship, weak and feeble
<span class="pb" id="Page_197">197</span>
as it is when compared with the songs of the sweet psalmist
of Israel.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_142" href="#fn_142">[142]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He did write a hymn at the Land&rsquo;s End, but it is of
quite a different type. It might have been written
for St. Augustine of Canterbury on his landing at
Ebbsfleet.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Divine Immanuel, come,</p>
<p class="t0">Take possession of Thy home,</p>
<p class="t0">Now Thy mercy&rsquo;s wings expand,</p>
<p class="t0">Stretch throughout the happy land.<a class="fn" id="fr_143" href="#fn_143">[143]</a></p>
</div>
<p>The popular hymn</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See how great a flame aspires,</p>
<p class="t">Kindled by a spark of grace!</p>
<p class="t0">Jesu&rsquo;s love the nations fires,</p>
<p class="t">Sets the kingdoms on a blaze&mdash;</p>
</div>
<p>tells of victory at Newcastle-on-Tyne.</p>

<div class="verse">

<h4>5. <span class="sc">Hymns of the Methodist Society</span></h4>
<p>The duty of a Methodist preacher was not simply
to sow good seed broadcast, but to gather those who
received the word into Societies, where they could be
taught, trained, watched over. A large part of John
Wesley&rsquo;s itinerations were for the purpose of confirming
and sifting the Societies. In many cases they might
be described as Charles Wesley, who had an eye
for the humorous side of people and things, describes
the Newcastle converts, &lsquo;a wild, loving, staring Society.&rsquo;
But the converts who remained steadfast were soon
led to an intelligent faith and a life of devotion such
as is possible only to those who are taught by educated
men or their pupils. The debt Methodism owes to
Oxford culture is inestimable. The Wesleys were
never discouraged by the ignorance of their hearers,
but they were never content with it. They had profound
faith in the Lord Jesus Christ as a teacher, and
prayed, like St. Paul for his simple-minded converts
at Philippi, that love might abound in good sense
and good taste.<a class="fn" id="fr_145" href="#fn_145">[145]</a></p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Him Prophet, and King, And Priest we proclaim,</p>
<p class="t0">We triumph and sing Of Jesus&rsquo;s name;</p>
<p class="t0">Poor idiots<a class="fn" id="fr_146" href="#fn_146">[146]</a> He teaches To show forth His praise,</p>
<p class="t0">And tell of the riches Of Jesus&rsquo;s grace.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_199">199</div>

<p class="t0">No matter how dull The scholar whom He</p>
<p class="t0">Takes into His school, And gives him to see;</p>
<p class="t0">A wonderful fashion Of teaching He hath,</p>
<p class="t0">And wise to salvation He makes us through faith.</p>
</div>
<p>To a generation brought up to regard Sankey&rsquo;s
<i>Songs and Solos</i> as the best possible hymns for mission-halls
and open-air services, a study of Wesley&rsquo;s hymns
is a liberal education. For the most ignorant of the
converts the hymns were the one and only means of
culture. They could not read, much of the preaching
must have been beyond their comprehension, but the
hymns, read slowly, a line at a time, soon became
familiar, and the favourite hymns sung over and over
again in the house, the class-room, and the family
circle, became a part of their very life. Methodist
biography shows how the life and death of the saints
has been cheered and sanctified by these spiritual songs.</p>
<p>The most important, and by far the largest, part
of Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Collection</i> was devoted to hymns of the
Christian life.</p>
<p>It is divided into sections: For Believers Rejoicing,
Fighting, Praying, Watching, Working, Suffering,
Seeking for Full Redemption, Saved, Interceding
for the World. It begins with his own translation of
Johann Andreas Rothe&rsquo;s great hymn</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now I have found the ground wherein</p>
<p class="t">Sure my soul&rsquo;s anchor may remain,</p>
<p class="t0">The wounds of Jesus, for my sin,</p>
<p class="t">Before the world&rsquo;s foundation slain;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose mercy shall unshaken stay,</p>
<p class="t0">When heaven and earth are fled away</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_200">200</div>
<p>This is followed by his version of Zinzendorf&rsquo;s hymn</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesu, Thy blood and righteousness</p>
<p class="t0">My beauty are, my glorious dress.</p>
</div>
<p>After these Moravian hymns are a number of Charles
Wesley&rsquo;s, which celebrate the joys of believers, for
&lsquo;How should not he be glad, whom the glad tidings
have reached?&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_147" href="#fn_147">[147]</a> It is often difficult to understand
John Wesley&rsquo;s principle of classification, but in this
section almost every hymn of the seventy-five is
obviously well placed under the title &lsquo;For Believers
Rejoicing.&rsquo; The notes of thanksgiving are very varied,
from the calm confidence of &lsquo;Now I have found the
ground&rsquo; to the simple songs written for him &lsquo;that in
God is merry,&rsquo; such as</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O what shall I do My Saviour to praise,</p>
<p class="t0">So faithful and true, So plenteous in grace,</p>
<p class="t0">So strong to deliver, So good to redeem</p>
<p class="t0">The weakest believer That hangs upon Him!</p>
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My God, I am Thine, What a comfort divine,</p>
<p class="t0">What a blessing to know That my Jesus is mine!</p>
</div>
<p>We cannot claim for these hymns that they introduce
new songs to the Christian choir. Joy and gladness
are common to all who have found salvation
through faith in Christ Jesus. Isaac Watts, Philip
Doddridge, F. W. Faber, Frances Ridley Havergal, and
many more have had &lsquo;the high praises of God in their
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
mouth.&rsquo; From the days of the Hebrew psalmists until
now the sense of infinite content which comes with the
peace which passeth all understanding has been the
theme of God&rsquo;s singers. &lsquo;He satisfieth the longing soul
and filleth the hungry soul with goodness.&rsquo; Yet
joyousness is a special characteristic of Methodist
hymns, and especially of those which were written in
the early days of the triumphs of the itinerant preachers.
No hymns rise higher in their exultant rapture, none
are more tenderly triumphant than the songs of Charles
Wesley.</p>
<p>His Birthday hymn exhibits the happy enthusiasm
of his evangelism.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">My remnant of days</p>
<p class="t2">I spend in His praise,</p>
<p class="t0">Who died the whole world to redeem;</p>
<p class="t2">Be they many or few,</p>
<p class="t2">My days are His due,</p>
<p class="t0">And they all are devoted to Him.</p>
</div>
<p>In other hymns he expresses the same joy in living
in calmer tones.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The winter&rsquo;s night and summer&rsquo;s day</p>
<p class="t0">Glide imperceptibly away,</p>
<p class="t2">Too short to sing Thy praise;</p>
<p class="t0">Too few we find the happy hours,</p>
<p class="t0">And haste to join those heavenly powers,</p>
<p class="t2">In everlasting lays.</p>
</div>
<p>Bright and inspiring as these pieces are, they are in
striking contrast with the hymns characteristic of minor
religious movements, and justify John Wesley&rsquo;s claim
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
that &lsquo;in these hymns is no doggerel.&rsquo; That they are of
unequal merit goes without saying, but it is remarkable
how many of them are living hymns to-day. Religious
feeling is no more healthy because it loves to pray for
guidance &lsquo;amid the encircling gloom,&rsquo; or to describe
the hosts of the Church militant as &lsquo;pilgrims of the
night.&rsquo; A &lsquo;sober standard of feeling&rsquo; must take into
account that the darkness has passed and the true light
now shineth.</p>
<p>Yet one who knows little of early Methodism would
be surprised to find how &lsquo;sober&rsquo; is the tone of most of
the hymns provided for the people called Methodists.
They are songs in which &lsquo;calmly reverential joy&rsquo; is more
often heard than ecstasy. It is instructive to turn from
Mr. Lecky&rsquo;s chapter on &lsquo;The Religious Revival,&rsquo; in his
<i>History of England in the Eighteenth Century</i> to Wesley&rsquo;s
hymns. The uninstructed reader of Mr. Lecky would
expect to find here the turbid, involved, hysterical
expression of a morbid fanaticism, but he would search
almost in vain for illustrations of that side of the
Methodist Movement. It is true that both the Wesleys
were perplexed by the physical effects of their preaching,
and were afraid to treat them as mere manifestations
of hysterical excitement. But they dealt
with them as St. Paul dealt with somewhat similar
phenomena at Corinth, and carefully avoided encouraging
such painful and inconvenient interruptions
of their services. The hymn-book makes no provision
for the nervously excited, and has no compositions of
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
the class characteristic of many &lsquo;revivals&rsquo;&mdash;such, for
instance, as are found in Hugh Bourne&rsquo;s <i>Hymns
for Camp Meetings, Revivals, etc.</i> The novelty, the
directness of the preaching, and, no doubt, the lack of
education of many of the preachers naturally led to
indiscretion in many places, especially in the early
days of the Revival; but it is fair to judge the Wesleys&rsquo;
own standard of religious emotion by their hymns
rather than by the extravagances of their least intelligent
helpers.</p>
<p>Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymn, &lsquo;For the Fear of God,&rsquo; is a
good example of the attitude of soul he desired for
himself and for Methodists generally.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">God of all grace and majesty,</p>
<p class="t">Supremely great and good!</p>
<p class="t0">If I have mercy<a class="fn" id="fr_148" href="#fn_148">[148]</a> found with Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Through the atoning blood,</p>
<p class="t0">The guard of all Thy mercies give,</p>
<p class="t">And to my pardon join</p>
<p class="t0">A fear lest I should ever grieve</p>
<p class="t">The gracious Spirit divine.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Rather I would in darkness mourn</p>
<p class="t">The absence of Thy peace,</p>
<p class="t0">Than e&rsquo;er by light irreverence turn</p>
<p class="t">Thy grace to wantonness:</p>
<p class="t0">Rather I would in painful awe</p>
<p class="t">Beneath Thine anger move,</p>
<p class="t0">Than sin against the gospel law</p>
<p class="t">Of liberty and love.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But O! Thou wouldst not have me live</p>
<p class="t">In bondage, grief, or pain,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou dost not take delight to grieve</p>
<p class="t">The helpless sons of men;</p>
<p class="t0">Thy will is my salvation, Lord;</p>
<p class="t">And let it now take place,</p>
<p class="t0">And let me tremble at the word</p>
<p class="t">Of reconciling grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Still may I walk as in Thy sight,</p>
<p class="t">My strict observer see;</p>
<p class="t0">And Thou by reverent love unite</p>
<p class="t">My child-like heart to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">Still let me, till my days are past,</p>
<p class="t">At Jesu&rsquo;s feet abide,</p>
<p class="t0">So shall He lift me up at last,</p>
<p class="t">And seat me by His side.</p>
</div>
<p>Perhaps there are few hymns quite of this type, but
the subdued and subduing sense of the fear of God
pervades many of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s poems. He dwells
much on &lsquo;the mystic joys of penitence,&rsquo; as in his brief
meditation on Ezek. xxxvi. 26, &lsquo;I will give you an
heart of flesh.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let me, according to Thy word,</p>
<p class="t">A tender, contrite heart receive,</p>
<p class="t0">Which grieves<a class="fn" id="fr_149" href="#fn_149">[149]</a> for having grieved its Lord</p>
<p class="t">And never can itself forgive;</p>
</div>
<p>a verse which reminds one of Cardinal Newman&rsquo;s
saying that true penitence never forgives itself.
This, however, is not what Charles Wesley meant, for
<span class="pb" id="Page_205">205</span>
he of all Christian poets best understood how truly the
pardoned prodigal might make merry and be glad when
he was safe in his Father&rsquo;s house once more.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lift up Thy countenance serene,</p>
<p class="t">And let Thy happy child</p>
<p class="t0">Behold, without a cloud between,</p>
<p class="t">The Godhead reconciled.</p>
</div>
<p>An important series of hymns&mdash;so important that it
demands separate consideration&mdash;is that which is found
in Sections vii.-ix. of the original hymn-book. They
include nearly one hundred pieces, and from the days
of John Wesley until the latest revision the section
began with a hymn which is the most fitting introduction
to the series, since it sets forth with great simplicity
the Wesleyan doctrine of Christian perfection. Familiar
as this hymn is to Methodists, it is worth while to
quote it in full here&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">The thing my God doth hate,</p>
<p class="t2">That I no more may do,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy creature, Lord, again create,</p>
<p class="t2">And all my soul renew;</p>
<p class="t2">My soul shall then, like Thine,</p>
<p class="t2">Abhor the thing unclean,</p>
<p class="t0">And, sanctified by love divine,</p>
<p class="t2">For ever cease from sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">That blessed law of Thine,</p>
<p class="t2">Jesus, to me impart;</p>
<p class="t0">The Spirit&rsquo;s law of life divine,</p>
<p class="t2">O write it in my heart!</p>
<p class="t2">Implant it deep within,</p>
<p class="t2">Whence it may ne&rsquo;er remove,</p>
<p class="t0">The law of liberty from sin,</p>
<p class="t2">The perfect law of love.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_206">206</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t2">Thy nature be my law,</p>
<p class="t2">Thy spotless sanctity,</p>
<p class="t0">And sweetly every moment draw</p>
<p class="t2">My happy soul to Thee.</p>
<p class="t2">Soul of my soul remain!</p>
<p class="t2">Who didst for all fulfil,</p>
<p class="t0">In me, O Lord, fulfil again</p>
<p class="t2">Thy heavenly Father&rsquo;s will!</p>
</div>
<p>This hymn is made up, as are many others, by joining
together verses from the <i>Short Hymns on Select Passages
of the Holy Scriptures</i>. The first verse is suggested by
Jer. xliv. 4: &lsquo;Oh, do not this abominable thing
that I hate.&rsquo; The second and third by Jer. xxxi.
33: &lsquo;I will put My law in their inward parts, and
write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they
shall be My people.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Another peaceful and attractive hymn on the same
subject is based on Heb. iv. 9: &lsquo;There remaineth
therefore a rest to the people of God.&rsquo; Charles Wesley
wrote twenty-seven verses; John Wesley selected eight,
these are reduced to six in the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i>.
I am inclined to think that a further abridgement
would have been still wiser. The four verses which
follow are a beautiful meditation on the text&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, I believe a rest remains</p>
<p class="t">To all Thy people known,</p>
<p class="t0">A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,</p>
<p class="t">And Thou art loved alone:</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A rest, where all our soul&rsquo;s desire</p>
<p class="t">Is fixed on things above;</p>
<p class="t0">Where fear, and sin, and grief expire,</p>
<p class="t">Cast out by perfect love.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_207">207</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O that I now the rest might know,</p>
<p class="t">Believe, and enter in!</p>
<p class="t0">Now, Saviour, now the power bestow,</p>
<p class="t">And let me cease from sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Remove this hardness from my heart,</p>
<p class="t">This unbelief remove:</p>
<p class="t0">To me the rest of faith impart,</p>
<p class="t">The Sabbath of Thy love.</p>
</div>
<p>The doctrine of Entire Sanctification, as it was
believed and taught by the Wesleys, is set forth in
the hymn-book with emphasis, but the expressions are
rarely open to serious objection, nearly every phrase
having Scriptural precedent. In early days Charles
Wesley had often prayed for death, believing that
through its gate alone could he find entrance into &lsquo;the
land of rest from inbred sin.&rsquo; In one of his first hymns,
published in 1739, he had written&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Fain would I leave this world below,</p>
<p class="t">Of pain and sin the dark abode,</p>
<p class="t0">Where shadowy joy or solid woe</p>
<p class="t">Allures or tears me from my God;</p>
<p class="t0">Doubtful and insecure of bliss,</p>
<p class="t0">Since death alone confirms me His.<a class="fn" id="fr_150" href="#fn_150">[150]</a></p>
</div>
<p>But in later years he had outgrown this mood. John
Wesley wrote <i>No</i> against the last line of the stanza, and
in his hymn-book gave&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Since <i>faith</i> alone confirms me His.</p>
</div>
<p>The brothers taught that sanctification was progressive,
yet might be &lsquo;cut short in righteousness,&rsquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
a phrase which they often quoted. In one of the hymns
for those that wait for &lsquo;full redemption,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_151" href="#fn_151">[151]</a> Charles
Wesley writes&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Surely I have pardon found,</p>
<p class="t0">Grace doth more than sin abound,</p>
<p class="t0">God, I know, is pacified;</p>
<p class="t0">Thou for me, for me hast died;</p>
<p class="t0">But I cannot rest herein,</p>
<p class="t0">All my nature still is sin,</p>
<p class="t0">Comforted I will not be</p>
<p class="t0">Till my soul is all like Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See my burdened, sin-sick soul,</p>
<p class="t0">Give me faith, and make me whole!</p>
<p class="t0">Finish Thy great work of grace,</p>
<p class="t0">Cut it short in righteousness.</p>
<p class="t0">Speak the second time, &lsquo;Be clean!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="t0">Take away my inbred sin;</p>
<p class="t0">Now the stumbling-block remove,</p>
<p class="t0">Cast it out by perfect love.</p>
</div>
<p>This doctrine of what has been called &lsquo;the second
blessing&rsquo; is often met with in Charles Wesley, but he
used expressions which John disapproved, and would
not repeat in his <i>Collection</i>, as in the second verse of the
great hymn, &lsquo;Love divine, all loves excelling,&rsquo; which
reads&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit,</p>
<p class="t">Into every troubled breast;</p>
<p class="t0">Let us all in Thee inherit,</p>
<p class="t">Let us find that second rest;</p>
<p class="t0">Take away the power of sinning,</p>
<p class="t">Alpha and Omega be;</p>
<p class="t0">End of faith as its beginning,</p>
<p class="t">Set our hearts at liberty.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_209">209</div>
<p>John Fletcher suggested that &lsquo;power&rsquo; should be altered
to &lsquo;love.&rsquo;</p>
<p>The Wesleys&rsquo; teaching concerning sanctification
had an immense influence upon Methodist life and
thought. &lsquo;The pursuit of holiness,&rsquo; to use Dean
Goulburn&rsquo;s phrase, was the daily interest and delight
of multitudes of devout souls. No doubt in many
cases there was more or less of morbid introspection,
but the rich treasury of Methodist biography witnesses
to the saintliness of those who made the search for &lsquo;full
redemption,&rsquo; or, as they delighted to say, &lsquo;perfect love,&rsquo;
the one serious business of life.</p>
<p>Important and influential as this section of Wesley&rsquo;s
<i>Hymns</i> is, not many of the best are found here.<a class="fn" id="fr_152" href="#fn_152">[152]</a> The
finest are John Wesley&rsquo;s translations from the German
but only a few original compositions are of marked value.
Some exceptions, indeed, must be made, notably&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love divine, all loves excelling;</p>
</div>
<p>and there are many verses inspired by that thirst of the
soul &lsquo;for God, yea, even for the living God,&rsquo; which is
characteristic of no one Church or age, but of all elect
souls restless till they find rest in Him. The varying
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
moods of the seeker after God are impressively illustrated.
Some of the hymns are of a solemn and
even sombre type, while others are bright with
assurance of the favour of God and the gladness of the
redeemed. Here are a few verses from a</p>
<h4>HYMN TO GOD THE SANCTIFIER</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Holy Ghost, all quickening fire!</p>
<p class="t0">Come, and my hallowed heart inspire,</p>
<p class="t">Sprinkled with the atoning blood;</p>
<p class="t0">Now to my soul Thyself reveal,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy mighty working let me feel,</p>
<p class="t">And know that I am born of God.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy witness with my spirit bear,</p>
<p class="t0">That God, my God, inhabits there;</p>
<p class="t">Thou, with the Father, and the Son,</p>
<p class="t0">Eternal Light&rsquo;s co-eval Beam;</p>
<p class="t0">Be Christ in me, and I in Him,</p>
<p class="t">Till perfect we are made in one.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let earth no more my heart divide,</p>
<p class="t0">With Christ may I be crucified,</p>
<p class="t">To Thee with my whole soul aspire;</p>
<p class="t0">Dead to the world and all its toys,</p>
<p class="t0">Its idle pomp, and fading joys,</p>
<p class="t">Be thou alone my one desire!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Be Thou my joy, be Thou my dread;</p>
<p class="t0">In battle cover Thou my head,</p>
<p class="t">Nor earth nor hell I then shall fear;</p>
<p class="t0">I then shall turn my steady face,</p>

<p>Of the other type two bright verses on 1 Chron.
xxix. 5 are a good example&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>These two verses belong to the very extensive series of</p>
<h4>6. <span class="sc">Hymns on Passages of Holy Scripture</span></h4>
<p>Charles Wesley&rsquo;s poetry is always sanctified by the
word of God. In this regard he is unsurpassed, and
I think unequalled, by any other writer. He thought
and wrote in the language of the Bible, and constantly
weaves into his hymns the words, phrases, incidents
<span class="pb" id="Page_212">212</span>
of Holy Scripture. No one &lsquo;spiritualized&rsquo; more boldly
than he. Of this his most famous poem, &lsquo;Wrestling
Jacob,&rsquo; is the great example. Many other hymns
illustrate the same power, e.g. this verse, which
&lsquo;spiritualizes&rsquo; Peter&rsquo;s deliverance from prison&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Long my imprisoned spirit lay</p>
<p class="t">Fast bound in sin and nature&rsquo;s night;</p>
<p class="t0">Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,</p>
<p class="t">I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;</p>
<p class="t0">My chains fell off, my heart was free,</p>
<p class="t0">I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.</p>
</div>
<p>and this, which refers in the same fashion to the resurrection
of Lazarus&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Buried in sin, Thy voice I hear,</p>
<p class="t">And burst the barriers of my tomb,</p>
<p class="t0">In all the marks of death appear,</p>
<p class="t">Forth at Thy call, though bound, I come.</p>
</div>
<p>His more formal paraphrases are often very fine,
and are hymns of permanent worth. Such are&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">None is like Jeshurun&rsquo;s God (Deut. xxxiii. 26-29).</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Wherewith, O God, shall I draw near (Mic. vi. 6-8).</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Away my unbelieving fear (Hab. iii. 17, 18).</p>
</div>
<p>Of course Charles Wesley wrote many Psalm-versions.
Comparatively few are above the average,
but there are some exceptions. Among these are
the 48th&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Great is our redeeming Lord,</p>
<p class="t0">In power, and truth, and grace.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_213">213</div>
<p>the 84th&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How lovely are Thy tents, O Lord!</p>
<p class="t0">Where&rsquo;er Thou choosest to record</p>
<p class="t">Thy name, or place Thy house of prayer,</p>
<p class="t0">My soul outflies the angel-choir,</p>
<p class="t0">And faints, o&rsquo;erpowered with strong desire,</p>
<p class="t">To meet Thy special presence there.</p>
</div>
<p>the 121st&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To the hills I lift mine eyes,</p>
<p class="t">The everlasting hills.</p>
</div>
<p>the 125th&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Who in the Lord confide</p>
<p class="t">And feel His sprinkled blood,</p>
<p class="t0">In storms and hurricanes abide,</p>
<p class="t">Firm as the mount of God.</p>
</div>
<p>Often only two or three verses can be taken from
a long poem, as in Ps. iii.&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou, Lord, art a shield for me.<a class="fn" id="fr_153" href="#fn_153">[153]</a></p>
</div>
<p>and Ps. ix.&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thee will I praise with all my heart.</p>
</div>
<p>Here the whole psalm, as it appears in the <i>Poetical
Works</i>, consists of fourteen verses, most of them impossible
for singing in a Christian Church, but there
are four good verses, especially this, with its tender
trustfulness that the humble seeker must at length find
his Saviour&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A helpless soul that looks to Thee</p>
<p class="t0">Is sure at last Thy face to see,</p>
<p class="t">And all Thy goodness to partake;</p>
<p class="t0">The sinner who for Thee doth grieve,</p>
<p class="t0">And longs, and labours to believe,</p>
<p class="t">Thou never, never wilt forsake.<a class="fn" id="fr_154" href="#fn_154">[154]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_214">214</div>
<p>The 23rd Psalm is also very beautiful, and is worthy
to take its place amongst the many lovely renderings
of this sweetest of the praises of Israel. I venture to
quote the whole, as it is little known outside Wesleyan
Methodism, and not too well known in our own Church.
It is the 23rd Psalm read in the light of the tenth
chapter of St. John&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus the good Shepherd is;</p>
<p class="t">Jesus died the sheep to save;</p>
<p class="t0">He is mine, and I am His;</p>
<p class="t">All I want in Him I have,</p>
<p class="t0">Life, and health, and rest, and food,</p>
<p class="t0">All the plenitude of God.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus loves and guards His own;</p>
<p class="t">Me in verdant pastures feeds;</p>
<p class="t0">Makes me quietly lie down,</p>
<p class="t">By the streams of comfort leads:</p>
<p class="t0">Following Him where&rsquo;er He goes,</p>
<p class="t0">Silent joy my heart o&rsquo;erflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He in sickness makes me whole,</p>
<p class="t">Guides into the paths of peace;</p>
<p class="t0">He revives my fainting soul,</p>
<p class="t">Stablishes in righteousness;</p>
<p class="t0">Who for me vouchsafed to die,</p>
<p class="t0">Loves me still,&mdash;I know not why!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Unappalled by guilty fear,</p>
<p class="t">Through the mortal vale I go;</p>
<p class="t0">My eternal Life is near;</p>
<p class="t">Thee my Life, in death I know;</p>
<p class="t0">Bless Thy chastening, cheering rod</p>
<p class="t0">Die into the arms of God!</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_215">215</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Till that welcome hour I see,</p>
<p class="t">Thou before my foes dost feed;</p>
<p class="t0">Bidd&rsquo;st me sit and feast with Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Pour&rsquo;st Thy oil upon my head;</p>
<p class="t0">Giv&rsquo;st me all I ask, and more,</p>
<p class="t0">Mak&rsquo;st my cup of joy run o&rsquo;er.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Love divine shall still embrace,</p>
<p class="t">Love shall keep me to the end;</p>

<p class="t0">Till I to Thy house remove,</p>
<p class="t0">Thy eternal house above!</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Watts&rsquo;s &lsquo;grand design&rsquo; in his version of the
Psalter was &lsquo;to teach&rsquo; the &lsquo;author to speak like a
Christian.&rsquo; Charles Wesley took St. Augustine&rsquo;s view,
that we ought to hear the voice of Christ in all the
psalms. His version of Ps. xlv. is typical of his
attitude toward the Psalter as a whole.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My heart is full of Christ, and longs</p>
<p class="t">Its glorious matter to declare!</p>
<p class="t0">Of Him I make my loftier songs,</p>
<p class="t">I cannot from His praise forbear;</p>
<p class="t0">My ready tongue makes haste to sing</p>
<p class="t0">The beauties of my heavenly King.</p>
</div>
<p>In 1762 Charles Wesley took advantage of a time
of physical weakness to write a large number of verses,
forming a kind of running commentary on the Holy
Scriptures. They are, for the most part, purely devotional;
but the events of the time and, perhaps, of
the day on which a poem was written are mirrored in
some of the verses. In the preface he says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_216">216</div>
<p>Many of the thoughts are borrowed from Mr. Henry&rsquo;s
<i>Commentary</i>, Dr. Gell on the <i>Pentateuch</i>, and Bengelius on
the <i>New Testament</i>. Several of the hymns are intended to
prove, and several to guard, the doctrine of Christian
Perfection. I durst not publish one without the other.
In the latter sort I use some severity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On this point the brothers differed, and especially
as to the method of treating those who discredited the
doctrine by extravagance in teaching or by inconsistency
of life.</p>
<p>The <i>Short Poems</i> account for the enormous number
of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s hymns. On the Old Testament he
wrote 1,609, on the New Testament 3,491, a total of
5,100 poetical notes on the Holy Scripture. But very
many consist of only one verse.<a class="fn" id="fr_155" href="#fn_155">[155]</a> By skilful combination
some very good hymns have been made, and
in a few instances we come upon a complete hymn
of great strength or beauty. Many of these are
familiar in Methodist congregations, though probably
few worshippers recognize the passages of Scripture
which suggested the verses. The well-known hymn</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">A charge to keep I have,</p>
</div>
<p>is the poet&rsquo;s meditation and prayer after reading
Lev. viii. 35: &lsquo;Therefore shall ye abide at the door
of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night
seven days, and keep the charge of the Lord, that ye
die not.&rsquo; After reading Lev. vi. 13: &lsquo;The fire shall
<span class="pb" id="Page_217">217</span>
ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out,&rsquo;
he prays</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Thou who camest from above</p>
<p class="t">The pure celestial fire to impart,</p>
<p class="t0">Kindle a flame of sacred love</p>
<p class="t">On the mean altar of my heart!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There let it for Thy glory burn</p>
<p class="t">With inextinguishable blaze;</p>
<p class="t0">And trembling to its source return,</p>
<p class="t">In humble prayer and fervent praise.</p>
</div>
<p>On the words &lsquo;merciful and gracious&rsquo; in Exod.
xxxiv. 6 he comments</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Mercy is Thy distinguished Name,</p>
<p class="t">And suits the sinner best.</p>
</div>
<p>On the twenty-ninth verse of the same chapter, &lsquo;Moses
wist not that his face shone,&rsquo; he writes</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thine image if Thou stamp on me,</p>
<p class="t0">Let others, Lord, the brightness see,</p>
<p class="t">By me unseen, unknown.</p>
</div>
<p>As these verses are buried in the last four volumes of
the <i>Poetical Works</i>, I venture to quote a few others
which have, I think, some special value, reminding one
at times of Herbert or Crashaw.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="tc"><span class="small">&lsquo;The Lord went His way&rsquo; (Gen. xviii. 33).</span></p>

<p class="t0">Lord, if from Thee this mark I have</p>

<p class="t0">And sacrifice the souls of men</p>
<p class="t">To idol unity!</p>
</div>
<p>John Wesley lets this pass without note or
comment, but when, on Num. xvi. 10, Charles wrote</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Raised from the people&rsquo;s lowest lees,</p>
<p class="t0">Guard, Lord, Thy preaching witnesses,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor let their pride the honour claim</p>
<p class="t0">Of sealing covenants in Thy name.</p>
</div>
<p>he notes on the first line, &lsquo;Query? J. W.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Here our detailed consideration of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s
hymns must end, though there are many others over
which one would be glad to linger. Some of the hymns
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
on Death and the Future Life are of great power,
though some have lost and others are losing their hold
upon Methodist worshippers. Charles Wesley&rsquo;s view
of death is well illustrated in these verses, which I
quote the more readily because, to my regret, they are
not found in the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i>. If they could
not often be sung in the congregation, there are times
when they would speak the inmost feeling of the devout
disciple.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O when shall we sweetly remove,</p>
<p class="t">O when shall we enter our rest,</p>
<p class="t0">Return to the Sion above,</p>
<p class="t">The mother of spirits distressed!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Not all the archangels can tell</p>
<p class="t">The joys of that holiest place,</p>
<p class="t0">When Jesus is pleased to reveal</p>
<p class="t">The light of His heavenly face.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis good at Thy word to be here,</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Tis better in Thee to be gone,</p>
<p class="t0">And see Thee in glory appear,</p>
<p class="t">And rise to a share of Thy throne.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To mourn for Thy coming is sweet,</p>
<p class="t">To weep at Thy longer delay;</p>
<p class="t0">But Thou, whom we hasten to meet,</p>
<p class="t">Shalt chase all our sorrows away.</p>
</div>
<p>This is not the tone of modern worship. It is
open to the charge of that &lsquo;other-worldliness&rsquo; of which
our time is so impatient and knows so little, but it
is the language of the disciples whom Jesus loves.
&lsquo;Having the desire to depart and be with Christ: for
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
it is very far better.&rsquo; &lsquo;He which testifieth these things
saith, Surely I come quickly. Amen. Even so, come,
Lord Jesus!&rsquo;</p>
<p class="tb">After Charles Wesley, Methodism had no great
hymn-writer, though Thomas Olivers (1725-99), one of
the early preachers, wrote one of the finest of our hymns
of adoration.</p>
<p>He was a man of considerable ability, but Wesley
had more confidence in him as a corrector of errors of
doctrine than of errors of the press. He left Toplady
to be &lsquo;corrected by one that is full his match, Mr.
Thomas Olivers,&rsquo; but he rejected Olivers as assistant-editor
of the <i>Arminian Magazine</i>, because &lsquo;the errata
are insufferable.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&lsquo;The God of Abraham praise&rsquo; was published at
Nottingham in a pamphlet of eight pages, with the
title, &lsquo;A Hymn to the God of Abraham. In three parts,
adapted to a celebrated air, sung by the priest, Signior
Leoni, &amp;c., at the Jews&rsquo; Synagogue in London.&rsquo; There
is only slight verbal resemblance between Olivers&rsquo;
version and the Hebrew original.<a class="fn" id="fr_156" href="#fn_156">[156]</a> He wrote a few
other hymns, not to be compared with this, yet indicating
considerable poetic power. One of them, &lsquo;On
the Last Judgement,&rsquo; was published at &lsquo;Leedes.&rsquo; It
contained twenty verses, and was afterwards altered, and
enlarged to thirty-six verses, Scripture references being
given in the margin of almost every line. Some verses
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
of this poem have been occasionally used in hymn-books,
and Lord Selborne gave twelve verses in his
<i>Book of Praise</i>. It is, however, little known. The
following are among the best verses.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, immortal King of Glory!</p>
<p class="t">Now with all Thy saints appear;</p>
<p class="t0">While astonished worlds adore Thee,</p>

<p class="t">Who Thy coming may abide?</p>
<p class="t3">All who loved Him,</p>
<p class="t">All who longed to see His day.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, He saith, ye heirs of glory,</p>
<p class="t">Come, ye purchase of My blood,</p>
<p class="t0">Claim the kingdom now before you,</p>

</div>
<p>John Bakewell (1721-1819), a Methodist schoolmaster,
wrote several hymns, and is widely known as
the author of &lsquo;Hail, Thou once despis&egrave;d Jesus.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_157" href="#fn_157">[157]</a>
Benjamin Rhodes (1743-1815), converted under the
preaching of Whitefield, and for many years a Methodist
preacher, wrote one really fine hymn, &lsquo;My heart and
voice I raise.&rsquo; Another of the early Methodist preachers,
John Murlin, &lsquo;the weeping prophet,&rsquo; published a small
volume of hymns, some of which are quite as good as
most of the eighteenth-century songs.</p>

<br />Eighteenth-century Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c10">III.&mdash;<span class="sc">The Olney Hymns</span></h3>
<p>The contribution of evangelical Churchmen,
apart from the Wesleys, to the hymnody of
the eighteenth century, is slight, with the
important exception of the remarkable collection of
hymns issued by William Cowper and John Newton,
which takes its title from the little Buckinghamshire
town in which Newton was for years curate for an
absentee vicar.</p>
<p>Our little England has been the mother of so many
famous sons that it often happens that some out-of-the-way
village or obscure country town is rich in memories
of the great and good, for</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Half of her dust has walked the rest</p>
<p class="t0">In poets, heroes, martyrs, sages.</p>
</div>
<p>Such a spot is Olney, the town of Cowper and of
Cowper&rsquo;s Mary, of John Newton, and for a time of
Thomas Scott, of whom Newman speaks as &lsquo;the writer
who made a deeper impression on my mind than any
other, and to whom (humanly speaking) I almost owe
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
my soul.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_158" href="#fn_158">[158]</a> Where William Carey, after some hesitation
on the ground of his slight abilities, was &lsquo;allowed
to go on preaching,&rsquo; and finally sent forth to the
ministry by the unanimous vote of the Baptist Church,
over which John Sutcliff presided. Where also
Dr. H. J. Gauntlett, when a boy of ten, was organist
at the parish church.<a class="fn" id="fr_159" href="#fn_159">[159]</a></p>
<p>The Olney hymns are at once the &lsquo;monument&rsquo; of
&lsquo;an intimate and endeared friendship&rsquo; and of a
memorable literary partnership. &lsquo;The old African
blasphemer&rsquo; must have felt it even more a matter of
thankfulness that he found himself collaborating with
William Cowper than that he should become minister
of the nearest church to the Mansion House. John
Newton&rsquo;s romantic story is too well known to be
repeated here. He is a unique figure in the Christian
choir, and the story of our hymn-writers would be
vastly poorer if his life were omitted.</p>
<p>Influenced, as he gladly recognized, by the mother
who died when he was a boy of seven, his soul lay
open to intellectual and spiritual impressions, even in
the midst of his wanderings and sins. Euclid, as well
as Thomas &agrave; Kempis, shared in the saving of his soul
and kept him from sinking to the level of his companions
and oppressors. His hair-breadth escapes
were so many and so remarkable that he might well
regard them as interpositions of Providence, indicating
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
that he was &lsquo;a chosen vessel&rsquo; whom God had designated
to special work when his hour should come.</p>
<p>Among the many interesting men who occupy
secondary places in the religious life of the eighteenth
century, he is one of the most interesting and attractive.
The promise of his childhood blighted by the death of
his mother, his restless, roving, adventurous manhood,
his pursuit of knowledge under difficulties, his seven
years&rsquo; faithful love for Mary Catlett, thoughts of whom
were never absent from his mind for an hour amidst
all his &lsquo;misery and wretchedness,&rsquo; the unegotistic
frankness of his <i>Authentic Narrative</i>, his profound
and thankful modesty,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The genuine meek humility,</p>
<p class="t0">The wonder why such love to me,</p>
</div>
<p>his genius for friendship, his good-humoured perplexity
as to his proper theological and ecclesiastical affinities,
his ready wit and manly tenderness, unite to make
John Newton&rsquo;s a name over which one may well linger.</p>
<p>He was a Calvinist for the same reason that the
Wesleys were Arminians. They were convinced that
only a love divine which included every soul of man
could have stooped to them. Newton believed that
only God&rsquo;s determinate counsel could have set such
wandering feet as his upon the rock and established his
goings. To such elect souls the divers ways of contradictory
theologies blend in the one path which leads
the sinner to the Saviour. &lsquo;The views,&rsquo; he says, &lsquo;I
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
have received of the doctrines of grace, are essential to
my peace, and I could not live a day or an hour without
them.&rsquo; He found them &lsquo;friendly to holiness,&rsquo; and
it was not in him to be &lsquo;ashamed of them.&rsquo; One of his
favourite stories was of an old woman near Olney,
whose views on predestination suited him exactly.
&lsquo;Ah! I have long settled that point; for if God had
not chosen me before I was born, I am sure He would
have seen nothing in me to have chosen me for afterwards.&rsquo;
But we can well believe that he was not a
satisfactory Calvinist from the &lsquo;highest&rsquo; point of view.
&lsquo;There were two sorts of Calvinists at Olney,&rsquo; he said,
&lsquo;and they always reminded me of the two baskets of
Jeremiah&rsquo;s figs.&rsquo;</p>
<p>His Churchmanship was like his Calvinism, convinced
but liberal, almost easy-going. He writes to
his friend, William Bull&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I know not how it is. I think my sentiments and
experience are as orthodox and Calvinistical as need be;
and yet I am a sort of speckled bird among my Calvinist
brethren. I am a mighty good Churchman, but pass
amongst such as a Dissenter in prunello. On the other
hand, the Dissenters (many of them, I mean) think me
defective, either in understanding or in conscience, for
staying where I am. Well, there is a middle party called
Methodists, but neither do my dimensions exactly fit with
them.... But there are a few among all parties who bear
with me and love me, and with this I must be content at
present.... Party walls, though stronger than the walls
of Babylon, must come down in the general ruin when the
earth and all its works shall be burned up, if not sooner.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_228">228</div>
<p>In truth, he also was one of those whom any Church
might gladly have adopted. He would have been
thoroughly happy and at home amongst the best of the
Dissenters, he would have been an ideal Methodist,
and his <i>Narrative</i> would have given an added glory
to the <i>Lives of Early Methodist Preachers</i>; but, notwithstanding
the difficulties which delayed his taking
orders, he was in his right place as a parish clergyman,
and had no reason to complain that he was not appreciated
in the Establishment. His <i>Apologia</i> shows
that when he desired to enter the ministry, Dissenters
were quite as much afraid of him as Churchmen, and were
as unwilling to ordain him as the archbishop himself.<a class="fn" id="fr_160" href="#fn_160">[160]</a></p>
<p>He entered the Church without any special prejudice
in its favour, but his conviction that he had
taken the right step grew stronger year by year. His
defence of the Prayer-book against the criticism of the
Dissenter who availed himself of Watts&rsquo;s <i>Psalms and
Hymns</i> is as effective as it is witty, and is enforced by
a characteristic anecdote of a preacher who used to
compose hymns line by line as he announced them
from the pulpit.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Crito freely will rehearse</p>
<p class="t0">Forms of praise and prayer in verse;</p>
<p class="t0">Why should Crito then suppose</p>
<p class="t0">Forms are sinful when in prose?</p>
<p class="t0">Must my form be deemed a crime</p>
<p class="t0">Merely for the want of rhyme?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_229">229</div>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s charity went a good deal beyond that of
the ordinary evangelical of his own and of many a later
day. In the <i>Apologia</i> he expresses with vigour his
conviction that &lsquo;the Lord has a people&rsquo; among the
members of the Roman and Greek Churches.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I should hope that they who, having themselves tasted
that the Lord is gracious, know the language of a heart
under the influence of His Spirit, would, in defiance of
Protestant prejudices, be of my mind if they had opportunity
of perusing the writings of some Papists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newton was not one of the great men of his age,
but he is remarkable, if not pre-eminent, for the
naturalness with which he speaks the common tongue
of the children of God. Father Faber, in the preface
to his <i>Hymns</i>, bears a somewhat reluctant witness to
this.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Catholics even are said to be sometimes found poring
with a devout and unsuspecting delight over the verses of
the Olney hymns, which the author (Faber) himself can
remember acting like a spell upon him for years, strong
enough to be for long a counter influence to very grave
convictions, and even now to come back from time to time
unbidden into the mind.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Faber deprecated the &lsquo;spell&rsquo; of the Olney
hymns, it is fair to remember that Newton concludes
his defence of devout Catholics by saying, &lsquo;However, I
desire to be thankful that I am not a Papist.&rsquo;</p>
<p>In 1764 the difficulties which beset his entrance to
the ministry ended, and he was ordained by the Bishop
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
of Lincoln to the curacy of Olney, which had been
secured for him by the Earl of Dartmouth,<a class="fn" id="fr_161" href="#fn_161">[161]</a> a devout
and liberal Churchman, commemorated in Cowper&rsquo;s
lines&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We boast some rich ones whom the gospel sways,</p>
<p class="t0">And one who wears a coronet and prays.</p>
</div>
<p>Newton was nearly forty when he entered upon his
first clerical employment. A few months after his
coming to Olney, Cowper and Mrs. Unwin stayed with
him at the vicarage for about six weeks, and from that
time they were bound together by the ties of a deep
affection. Newton recognized with his usual shrewdness
how much he was inferior to his friend in
intellectual capacity, but he was able to give to the
sorely tried poet, in his fits of depression, much comfort
and a very patient friendship. When in 1773 one of
Cowper&rsquo;s worst attacks came on, he went to the vicarage
and remained there for more than twelve months. It
was no light trial to Newton, but he said, &lsquo;I think I
can hardly do or suffer too much for such a friend,&rsquo; and
&lsquo;upon the whole&rsquo; he was not weary of his &lsquo;cross.&rsquo; It
has sometimes, most ungenerously, been charged against
Newton that his influence tended to produce, or to
aggravate, the religious melancholy of the poet, but
Cowper&rsquo;s malady had been very pronounced long before
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
Newton met him. Richard Cecil, and more recently
Canon Overton, have defended Newton against this
accusation. Cowper&rsquo;s morbid depression must have
been much more trying to Newton than Newton&rsquo;s
humble, cheerful faith could have been to Cowper.
Indeed, his playful poems addressed to John Newton
and his wife and to their common friend, &lsquo;the smoke-inhaling
Bull&rsquo;&mdash;the Independent minister of Newport
Pagnell, whom Cowper calls &lsquo;a man of letters and of
genius.... but he smokes tobacco&mdash;nothing is perfect&rsquo;&mdash;sufficiently
show how genial and even jovial
was their friendship. The fable that Nonconformist
ministers and Evangelical clergymen are either rank
hypocrites or intolerable dullards, though it had, and
perhaps still has, the support of many great authorities,
is only believed in circles profoundly ignorant of them.</p>
<p>Yet Newton must have been greatly indebted,
especially as a hymn-writer, to Cowper. His hymns
were all written during his residence at Olney, and
he had intended that his share in the volume
should have been much less than Cowper&rsquo;s. Indeed,
when his friend&rsquo;s &lsquo;long and affecting indisposition&rsquo;
occurred, he laid the project aside for some time.
In the end the collection appeared with sixty-eight of
Cowper&rsquo;s and two hundred and eighty of Newton&rsquo;s.
Of Cowper&rsquo;s hymns, some few had been written before
he went to Olney, e.g. &lsquo;The Happy Change&rsquo; and
&lsquo;Retirement.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Cowper is the one great hymn-writer who ranks
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
with the greater poets. Montgomery, Heber, Milman,
all wrote &lsquo;poems,&rsquo; but their enduring poetic monument
is in their hymns. Had Cowper never written a hymn,
he would have had fame sufficient as a poet; had he
never written a &lsquo;poem,&rsquo; he would still have lived
through the ages as the writer of immortal hymns.
Lord Selborne says that Cowper&rsquo;s contributions to
the Olney collection &lsquo;are, almost without exception,
worthy of his name&rsquo;; but, as a fact, many of them
are prosaic and feeble, apparently written as task
work, perhaps to meet a challenge of Newton&rsquo;s, or to
follow a particular sermon. Cowper&rsquo;s choicest hymns
are too well known for quotation&mdash;</p>
<dl class="simple"><dt>O for a closer walk with God.</dt>
<dt>Hark, my soul, it is the Lord.</dt>
<dt>Sometimes a light surprises.</dt>
<dt>God moves in a mysterious way.</dt>
<dt>Jesus, where&rsquo;er Thy people meet.</dt></dl>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s best are&mdash;</p>
<dl class="simple"><dt>Glorious things of thee are spoken.</dt>
<dt>How sweet the name of Jesus sounds.</dt>
<dt>Quiet, Lord, my froward heart.</dt>
<dt>Come, my soul, thy suit prepare.</dt></dl>
<p>And the simple Spiritual songs&mdash;</p>
<dl class="simple"><dt>Begone, unbelief, my Saviour is near.</dt>
<dt>Though troubles assail and dangers affright.</dt></dl>
<div class="pb" id="Page_233">233</div>
<p>Like Watts, Doddridge, Beddome, and many others,
Newton wrote his hymns for use after preaching or for
some special occasion, such as the opening of a room
at the Great House for prayer-meetings and children&rsquo;s
services. It was for this event that Cowper wrote</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, where&rsquo;er Thy people meet,</p>
</div>
<p>and Newton a less effective hymn&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dear Shepherd of Thy people, hear,</p>
<p class="t">Thy presence now display;</p>
<p class="t0">As Thou hast given a place for prayer,</p>
<p class="t">So give us hearts to pray.</p>
</div>
<p>I do not suppose that the Olney hymns were often
selected as a hymn-book for congregational use. The
range of subjects is too narrow, and is so largely affected
by the circumstances of composition, the sadness of
Cowper&rsquo;s prolonged illness, and the needs of the rustic
worshippers, that it is, as a whole, more suited to
private devotion than public worship, though from it
may be gathered some of the most beautiful of the songs
of Zion.</p>
<p>From twelve to twenty of the Olney hymns have
won a permanent place in our hymn-books, but what is
left is very far from being &lsquo;empty chaff well meant for
grain.&rsquo; Indeed, there are very few hymn-books of the
eighteenth century so <i>interesting</i> as this. When you
have picked out of Watts or Doddridge their best
hymns, you find it a wearisome and profitless task to
plod through the remainder. An outrageous rhyme is
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
a pleasing break in the dull monotony of the sentiment,
but the Olney hymns, even at their feeblest, have life
and vigour, and are often provokingly easy to remember.
Their influence on modern hymnody has been all in
favour of the expression of personal, individual experience,
in which regard they may not unfairly be
compared with many of the sublimest Psalms.</p>
<p>In Cowper&rsquo;s verses there are often references to his
own depressed and anxious state of mind, and pathetic
prayers for deliverance or suggestions of comfortable
thoughts.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">She, too, who touched Thee in the press,</p>
<p class="t">And healing virtue stole,</p>
<p class="t0">Was answered, &lsquo;Daughter, go in peace,</p>
<p class="t">Thy faith hath made thee whole.&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Concealed amid the gathering throng,</p>
<p class="t">She would have shunned Thy view;</p>
<p class="t0">And if her faith was firm and strong,</p>
<p class="t">Had strong misgivings too.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like her with hopes and fears we come,</p>
<p class="t">To touch Thee, if we may:</p>

<h4>THE CONTRITE HEART</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The Lord will happiness divine</p>
<p class="t">On contrite hearts bestow;</p>
<p class="t0">Then tell me, gracious God, is mine</p>
<p class="t">A contrite heart, or no?</p>

</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I sometimes think myself inclined</p>
<p class="t">To love Thee, if I could;</p>
<p class="t0">But often feel another mind,</p>
<p class="t">Averse to all that&rsquo;s good.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thy saints are comforted, I know,</p>
<p class="t">And love Thy house of prayer;</p>
<p class="t0">I therefore go where others go,</p>
<p class="t">But find no comfort there.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, make this heart rejoice or ache,</p>
<p class="t">Decide this doubt for me;</p>
<p class="t0">And if it be not broken, break&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">And heal it, if it be!</p>
</div>
<h4>THE WAITING SOUL</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Breathe from the gentle south, O Lord,</p>
<p class="t">And cheer me from the north;</p>
<p class="t0">Blow on the treasures of Thy word,</p>

<p class="t0">And when He calls His exile home,</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_236">236</div>
<h4>PRAYER FOR PATIENCE</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, who hast suffered all for me,</p>
<p class="t">My peace and pardon to procure,</p>
<p class="t0">The lighter cross I bear for Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Help me with patience to endure.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The storm of loud repining hush,</p>
<p class="t">I would in humble silence mourn;</p>
<p class="t0">Why should the unburnt, though burning bush,</p>
<p class="t">Be angry as the crackling thorn?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ah! were I buffeted all day,</p>
<p class="t">Mocked, crowned with thorns, and spit upon,</p>
<p class="t0">I yet should have no right to say,</p>
<p class="t">My great distress is mine alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Let me not angrily declare</p>
<p class="t">No pain was ever sharp like mine,</p>
<p class="t0">Nor murmur at the cross I bear,</p>
<p class="t">But rather weep, remembering Thine.</p>
</div>
<p>Cowper&rsquo;s hymns are not all the voice of the
penitent or of the anxious believer. He shared
Newton&rsquo;s opinion as to the classification of Calvinists,
and two of his compositions evidently refer to the
second basket of figs. They illustrate Hazlitt&rsquo;s criticism,
&lsquo;His satire is excellent. It is pointed and
forcible, with the polished manners of the gentleman
and the honest indignation of the virtuous man.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_162" href="#fn_162">[162]</a>
The following verses are a good example of his satire.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_237">237</div>
<h4>A LIVING AND A DEAD FAITH</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With golden bells, the priestly vest,</p>
<p class="t">And rich pomegranates bordered round,</p>
<p class="t0">The need of holiness expressed,</p>
<p class="t">And called for fruit as well as sound.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Easy indeed it were to reach</p>
<p class="t">A mansion in the courts above,</p>
<p class="t0">If swelling words and fluent speech</p>
<p class="t">Might serve instead of faith and love.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">But none shall gain the blissful place,</p>
<p class="t">Or God&rsquo;s unclouded glory see,</p>
<p class="t0">Who talks of free and sovereign grace,</p>
<p class="t">Unless that grace has made him free!</p>
</div>
<p>This is not a favourite strain of Cowper&rsquo;s. His
hymns are nearly always the expression of personal
emotion or experience. We may close our quotations
from his Olney hymns with one which expresses, in
his own way, the common yearning of all who love
our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<h4>LONGING TO BE WITH CHRIST</h4>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">My Saviour, whom absent I love,</p>
<p class="t">Whom, not having seen, I adore;</p>
<p class="t0">Whose name is exalted above</p>
<p class="t">All glory, dominion, and power;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dissolve Thou these bonds that detain</p>
<p class="t">My soul from her portion in Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Ah! strike off this adamant chain,</p>
<p class="t">And make me eternally free.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh then shall the veil be removed,</p>
<p class="t">And round me Thy brightness be poured,</p>
<p class="t0">I shall meet Him whom absent I loved,</p>
<p class="t">I shall see Him whom unseen I adored.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_238">238</div>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s contribution to the Olney hymns is considerable
both in quality and quantity. His preface
disarms criticism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dr. Watts might, as a poet, have a right to say, &lsquo;That
it cost him some labour to restrain his fire, and to accommodate
himself to the capacities of common readers.&rsquo; But
it would not become me to make such a declaration. It behoved
me to do my best.... If the Lord, whom I serve, has
been pleased to favour me with that mediocrity of talent,
which may qualify me for usefulness to the weak and the
poor of His flock, without quite disgusting persons of
superior discernment, I have reason to be satisfied.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is quite refreshing to find a hymn-writer who describes
himself thus. They have often been modest
men and women, but have had a fairly good idea of
the value of their own compositions.</p>
<p>Newton&rsquo;s hymns are, even more than those of
Watts or Doddridge, pastoral hymns. Other men
wrote for the congregation, he wrote for his own
particular congregation, and very often with a special
reference to one member of it. We know that his
sermons were suggested in this way. If &lsquo;Sir Cowper&rsquo;
had a bad fit, or the Vicarage maid, Molly, was &lsquo;perplexed
and tempted on the point of election,&rsquo; the
kind-hearted pastor had a sermon and a hymn, suited
to their &lsquo;state,&rsquo; ready on Sunday.</p>
<p>Many of Newton&rsquo;s pieces express much more
of Cowper&rsquo;s experience than of his own. In
such lines as the following is not his eye upon
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
the sad figure in &lsquo;the poet&rsquo;s corner&rsquo; in the Great
House?</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sure the Lord thus far has brought me</p>
<p class="t">By His watchful tender care,</p>
<p class="t0">Sure &rsquo;tis He Himself has taught me</p>
<p class="t">How to seek His face by prayer:</p>
<p class="t2">After so much mercy past,</p>
<p class="t2">Will He give me up at last?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In my Saviour&rsquo;s intercession</p>
<p class="t">Therefore I will still confide!</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, accept my free confession,</p>
<p class="t">I have sinned, but Thou hast died:</p>
<p class="t2">This is all I have to plead,</p>
<p class="t2">This is all the plea I need.</p>
</div>
<p>That is what he has to say of &lsquo;Confidence&rsquo; from
Cowper&rsquo;s point of view. When he speaks for himself
he adopts a different tone.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh! I tremble still to think</p>
<p class="t">How secure I lived in sin;</p>
<p class="t0">Sporting on destruction&rsquo;s brink,</p>
<p class="t">Yet preserved from falling in.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, my fellow-sinners, try,</p>
<p class="t">Jesu&rsquo;s heart is full of love!</p>
<p class="t0">Oh that you, as well as I,</p>
<p class="t">May His wondrous mercy prove.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He has sent me to declare,</p>
<p class="t">All is ready, all is free:</p>

<p>Perhaps it was with Cowper in his mind he wrote
that beautiful and touching hymn for private devotion,
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
which has been often most unjustly censured&mdash;&lsquo;&rsquo;Tis a
point I long to know.&rsquo; Newton, like Bunyan, knew
how sincere a pilgrim Mr. Little Faith was, and each
in his own way sought to comfort him. There is good
robust common sense in the prayer of the last two
verses. In strength and beauty it does not compare
with Cowper&rsquo;s hymn on the same text, &lsquo;Lovest thou
Me?&rsquo; which Mr. Gladstone reckoned one of the three
greatest English hymns; but it belongs to the Christian
treasury, and has brought help to many.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, decide the doubtful case,</p>
<p class="t">Thou who art Thy people&rsquo;s sun,</p>
<p class="t0">Shine upon the work of grace,</p>
<p class="t">If it be indeed begun.</p>

<div class="verse">

<p>The tenderness of &lsquo;the old African blasphemer&rsquo;s&rsquo;
heart is nowhere more touchingly illustrated than in
his version of Isa. liv. 5-11, which must surely have
been written for Cowper, since it quotes and emphasizes
the words of his own great hymn. It has five eight-line
verses, and is headed &lsquo;To the Afflicted, Tossed
with Tempest, and not Comforted.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Pensive, doubting, fearful heart,</p>
<p class="t">Hear what Christ the Saviour says;</p>
<p class="t0">Every word should joy impart,</p>
<p class="t">Change thy mourning into praise.</p>

<p>Richard Cecil says that Herbert was a &lsquo;favourite&rsquo;
of Newton&rsquo;s, and there are not wanting reminiscences
of Herbert in the Olney hymns, though Newton had
little of Herbert&rsquo;s ingenuity or power, and he says in
a few plain words what Herbert weaves into a quaint
poem, bright and ever-memorable with some &lsquo;conceit&rsquo;
such as he only conceived. If we set Newton and
Herbert side by side, the comparison is, of course, all
in favour of Herbert. Herbert speaks to himself and
to God in what is an unknown tongue to many a good
plain Christian. Newton wrote for his simple labouring
folk at Olney; he is the poet of the rustic prayer-meeting.
Bemerton and Olney were both villages in
the land of Beulah, but there is a difference in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
dialect, which is easily accounted for when we remember
the contrast between the life of Herbert and of
Newton. When they passed through a similar spiritual
experience they described it in very different fashion,
but, though there are diversities of gifts, there is the
same Spirit; there is the same self-distrust, self-abhorrence;
and there is the same calm acceptance of the
great salvation and its joys. George Herbert tells his
deepest, sweetest experience in the final poem of <i>The
Temple</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_163" href="#fn_163">[163]</a> Newton tells his story in simple, homely verse
that is not poetry, but is prayer and praise expressed in
natural rhythm.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Dost Thou ask me who I am?</p>
<p class="t0">Ah, my Lord, Thou know&rsquo;st my name:</p>
<p class="t0">Yet the question gives a plea</p>
<p class="t0">To support my suit with Thee.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou didst once a wretch behold,</p>
<p class="t0">In rebellion blindly bold,</p>

<br />Eighteenth-century Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c11">IV.&mdash;<span class="sc">Addison, Toplady, and Others</span></h3>
<p>A few other hymn-writers of the eighteenth
century remain to be mentioned. The first
writer is of a very different class from those
of the later years. In 1712 Joseph Addison published
six hymns in successive numbers of the
<i>Spectator</i>. One was by Dr. Watts; the others were
undoubtedly his own, though the authorship has been
claimed for others. The hymns themselves are the
work of a devout man of letters, and, without being
exactly &lsquo;popular,&rsquo; have been and still are extensively
used. They have the easy grace of Addison&rsquo;s prose-writings,
and his name made them at once acceptable
to all classes. They belong to no school, and are used
by all the Churches.</p>
<p>The six hymns are&mdash;&lsquo;The Lord my pasture shall
prepare&rsquo;; &lsquo;When all Thy mercies, O my God&rsquo;;
&lsquo;When Israel, freed from Pharaoh&rsquo;s hand&rsquo; (Watts);
&lsquo;The spacious firmament on high&rsquo;; &lsquo;How are Thy
servants blest, O Lord&rsquo;; &lsquo;When rising from the bed
of death.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>John Cennick (1718-55) had much of Newton&rsquo;s
simplicity and sincerity, though he had not his touches
of genius or any trace of the old sea-farer&rsquo;s raciness.
Cennick was &lsquo;found&rsquo; by John Wesley at Reading, in
1739, and was one of his earliest lay-preachers. But
he adopted Calvinistic views, and soon left the
Methodists and attached himself to Whitefield, whom
he served as a brother beloved for several years. He
bore reproach, violence, hardship, with the courage
which characterized the itinerants of that day of either
school of theology. He separated from Wesley in
1741, from Whitefield in 1745, and found a more congenial
home among the Moravians. He was ordained
a deacon, and ministered in London and Dublin. He
it was who earned for Protestants of the Methodist
type the nickname of &lsquo;swaddlers,&rsquo; so long common in
Ireland. &lsquo;A name given to Mr. Cennick, first by a
Popish priest, who heard him speak of a Child wrapped
in swaddling-clothes, and probably did not know the
expression was in the Bible, a book he was not much
acquainted with.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_164" href="#fn_164">[164]</a></p>
<p>Cennick was vacillating, and apparently easily
influenced by stronger minds than his own, but he was
not able to keep up a quarrel, and, ten years after his
defection from Wesley, wrote him an affectionate letter,
in which he wishes &lsquo;heartily that Christians conferring
together had hindered the making that wide space
between us and you.&rsquo; Whitefield, though he had
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
suffered a larger defection from his Society than
Wesley, bore Cennick no ill will, but kept up an
affectionate correspondence with him to the end. &lsquo;My
dear John,&rsquo; he wrote in 1747, &lsquo;I wish thee much success,
and shall always pray that the work of the Lord
may prosper in thy hands.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_165" href="#fn_165">[165]</a> Cennick continued his
abundant labours till 1755, when he died in London in
his thirty-seventh year.</p>
<p>His best-known hymn is in every collection&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Children of the heavenly King,</p>
<p class="t0">As ye journey, sweetly sing;</p>
</div>
<p>and notwithstanding the dreadful rhyme of its second
verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou dear Redeemer, dying Lamb</p>
</div>
<p>still finds a place in many hymn-books.</p>
<p>Cennick is often spoken of as the author of</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lo! He comes with clouds descending;</p>
</div>
<p>but there is very little trace of Cennick&rsquo;s hymn in
Charles Wesley&rsquo;s. Canon Ellerton calls the hymn
&lsquo;a recast by Charles Wesley,&rsquo; and adds, &lsquo;Cennick&rsquo;s
hymn is poor stuff compared to that into which Wesley
recast it, putting into it at once fire and tunefulness.&rsquo;
This, however, is an inaccurate statement of the facts.
Probably Cennick&rsquo;s hymn suggested Wesley&rsquo;s, but this
is the only share Cennick had in it.</p>
<p>Cennick&rsquo;s hymn was published in 1752, Wesley&rsquo;s in
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
1758. In 1760 Martin Madan pieced together six
verses, five (with some alterations) from these two
hymns, and one from another of Wesley&rsquo;s. Neither
Cennick&rsquo;s original nor Madan&rsquo;s can be compared with
Wesley&rsquo;s fine verses, which are best left as he wrote
them.<a class="fn" id="fr_166" href="#fn_166">[166]</a> The following is Cennick&rsquo;s original&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>Augustus Montague Toplady (1740-78) was a
devout clergyman, converted through the preaching of
a Methodist in Ireland. His &lsquo;Arminian prejudices&rsquo;
received an &lsquo;effectual shock&rsquo; in 1758. His ministry at
Broad Hembury, and in the French Reformed Church,
Leicester Fields, was greatly valued, and his sincere
piety impressed all who knew him.</p>
<p>He was one of the most violent opponents of
Wesley and Fletcher in the Calvinistic controversy,
and expressed himself in unmeasured terms. He was
a good man, with deep convictions and narrow views.
Yet he touched human hearts as few other hymn-writers
have ever done. To have written &lsquo;Rock of
Ages&rsquo; would have been fame enough for a much greater
man than Toplady. It appeared in a curious and unpromising
setting. Toplady was editing the <i>Gospel
Magazine</i>, and in 1776 published a <i>Spiritual Improvement</i>
of a Catechism on the National Debt, in which he
strives to estimate the number of individual sins a man
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
may be expected to commit in the course of his earthly
life.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As we never, in the present life, rise to the mark of
legal sanctity, is it not fairly inferrible that our sins
multiply with every second of our sublunary durations?</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis too true. And in this view of the matter, our
dreadful account stands as follows:&mdash;At ten years old, each
of us is chargeable with 315 millions and 36 thousand sins.
At twenty, with 630 millions and 720 thousand. At thirty,
with 946 millions and 80 thousand. At forty, with 1,261
millions and 440 thousand. At fifty, with 1,576 millions
and 800 thousand. At sixty, with 1,892 millions and
160 thousand. At seventy, with 2,207 millions and 520
thousand. At eighty, with 2,522 millions and 880 thousand.</p>
<p>We can only admire and bless the Father for electing
us in Christ, and for laying on Him the iniquities of us all;
the Son for taking our nature and our debts upon Himself,
and for that complete righteousness and sacrifice whereby
He redeemed His mystical Israel from all their sins; and
the co-&aelig;qual Spirit for causing us (in conversion) to feel
our need of Christ, for inspiring us with faith to embrace
Him, for visiting us with His sweet consolations by shedding
abroad His love in our hearts, for sealing us to the day of
Christ, and for making us to walk in the path of His
commandments.</p>
<p><i>A living and dying</i> <span class="sc">Prayer</span> <i>for the</i> <span class="sc">Holiest Believer</span> <i>in the world</i>.</p>

<p class="t0">Let me hide myself in Thee!</p>
<p class="t0">Let the Water and the Blood</p>

<p class="t0">Be of Sin the double Cure,</p>
<p class="t0">Cleanse me from its Guilt and Power.<a class="fn" id="fr_167" href="#fn_167">[167]</a></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_249">249</div>
<p>Toplady wrote a good many hymns, but no other
compares with this great universal prayer, probably the
best-known and best-loved hymn in the language. He
was essentially a Methodist, his Calvinism being, one
might almost say, accidental. His hymns have the tone
and even the mannerisms of Charles Wesley.<a class="fn" id="fr_168" href="#fn_168">[168]</a> Many
of them are good devotional reading. The following
verses will remind many readers of some well-known
lines of Charles Wesley&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O when wilt Thou my Saviour be?</p>
<p class="t">O when shall I be clean,</p>
<p class="t0">The true, eternal Sabbath see,</p>
<p class="t">A perfect rest from sin?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The consolations of Thy word</p>

<p class="t0">The faithful promise of the Lord</p>
<p class="t">Shall surely be fulfilled.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I look to my Incarnate God,</p>
<p class="t">&rsquo;Till He His work begin,</p>
<p class="t0">And wait &rsquo;till His redeeming blood</p>
<p class="t">Shall cleanse me from all sin.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">His great salvation I shall know,</p>
<p class="t">And perfect liberty;</p>
<p class="t0">Onward to sin he cannot go,</p>
<p class="t">Whoe&rsquo;er abides in Thee:</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Added to the Redeemer&rsquo;s fold,</p>
<p class="t">I shall in Him rejoice,</p>
<p class="t0">I all His glory shall behold,</p>
<p class="t">And hear my Shepherd&rsquo;s voice.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_250">250</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O that I now the voice might hear</p>
<p class="t">That speaks my sins forgiven!</p>
<p class="t0">His word is past to give me <i>here</i></p>
<p class="t">The inward pledge of heaven.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">His blood shall over all prevail</p>
<p class="t">And sanctify the unclean;</p>
<p class="t0">The grace that saves from future hell</p>
<p class="t">Shall save from present sin.</p>
</div>
<p>In no part of the kingdom was the Evangelical
Revival more influential than in Wales. Whitefield,
Howell Harris, and, perhaps more than all, Lady
Huntingdon, were the controlling minds, and they led
the people of the Principality to the Calvinistic rather
than to the Wesleyan Methodists. The quaint poetry
of Vicar Rees Prichard&rsquo;s <i>Welshman&rsquo;s Candle</i> and the
Psalms of Archdeacon Prys seem to have been the
songs of the Welsh Church until William Williams of
Pantycelyn arose&mdash;a great light, well worthy to be
called the Watts of Wales. His father was deacon of
an Independent Church, which at one time met &lsquo;in a
cave during the hours of twilight,&rsquo; for fear of their
enemies. Williams himself was studying medicine,
and had no thought of the ministry. One Sunday
morning, as he passed through Talgarth in Breconshire,
he went into the parish church. After the service the
congregation gathered in the churchyard, and Howell
Harris, standing on a tomb-stone, preached with the
Holy Ghost and with power. That was the hour of
Williams&rsquo;s conversion. He prepared for the ministry
of the Established Church, and was ordained deacon in
<span class="pb" id="Page_251">251</span>
1740. He acted as curate of two small parishes for
three years, and then, drawn into the current of the
Revival under the influence of Whitefield, David
Rowlands, and Howell Harris, he became an earnest
evangelist, travelling throughout the Principality. His
hymn-writing is said to have been occasioned by a
challenge of Howell Harris to the Welsh Calvinistic
preachers to write better hymns than their congregations
then possessed. He wrote hymns by the hundred,
and they won an immediate and enduring popularity
in Wales. &lsquo;What Paul Gerhardt has been to Germany,
what Isaac Watts has been to England, that and more
has William Williams of Pantycelyn been to Wales.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_169" href="#fn_169">[169]</a>
He was a great favourite with Lady Huntingdon, at
whose suggestion he prepared a volume of hymns for
Whitefield&rsquo;s Orphan House. In this work, entitled
<i>Gloria in Excelsis</i>, some of his best hymns appeared.
In modern hymn-books he is known by two hymns&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Guide me, O Thou great Jehovah!</p>
</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O&rsquo;er those gloomy hills of darkness.</p>
</div>
<p>It is probable that the English version of his greatest
hymn was written by himself, and this seems to
indicate that he suffers in translation, for none of the
English versions of his other poems is to be compared
with this. Mr. Garrett Horder thinks that &lsquo;Guide me,
O Thou great Jehovah&rsquo; has been largely supplanted by
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
&lsquo;Lead, kindly Light,&rsquo; though the most recent hymn-books
do not sustain this criticism. Keble re-wrote,
but failed to improve it; and the same may be said of
those who have made minor alterations. It is, and is
likely to remain, one of the great songs of the Christian
pilgrim in his progress from this world unto that which
is to come.</p>
<p>Mr. Elvet Lewis has given several translations of
hymns hitherto unknown to English people, which are
good reading, though perhaps none are likely to attain
extensive use. Here are two verses in Williams&rsquo;s
favourite metre&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Much I love the faithful pilgrims,</p>
<p class="t">Who the rugged steeps ascend;</p>
<p class="t0">On their hands and knees they labour</p>
<p class="t">To attain the heavenly end;</p>
<p class="t2">To the summit</p>
<p class="t0">On my knees shall I come too.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bruis&egrave;d hands, oh! stretch ye upward,</p>
<p class="t">Tired feet, walk ye with care;</p>
<p class="t0">The reward, the crown is yonder,</p>
<p class="t">My Belov&egrave;d&mdash;He is there!</p>
<p class="t2">Earth forsaking</p>
<p class="t0">Now the journey&rsquo;s end is all.</p>
</div>
<p>Here are two more in another metre, and with the
cheery rhythm of John Newton&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here I know myself a stranger,</p>
<p class="t">And my native country lies</p>
<p class="t0">Far beyond the ocean&rsquo;s danger</p>
<p class="t">In the lands of Paradise:</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_253">253</div>
<p class="t0">Storms of trial blowing keenly</p>
<p class="t">Drive me on this foreign strand;</p>
<p class="t0">Come, O South wind, blow serenely,</p>
<p class="t">Speed me to my Fatherland.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Now the air is full of balm</p>
<p class="t">With the fragrance of the land;</p>
<p class="t0">And the breezes clear and calm</p>
<p class="t">Tell of Paradise at hand:</p>
<p class="t0">Come, ye much-desired regions,</p>
<p class="t">With the best of joy in store;</p>
<p class="t0">Country of the singing legions,</p>
<p class="t">Let me reach thy restful shore!</p>
</div>
<p>Williams had the spirit of devout enthusiasm which
characterized the Revival; his missionary hymns,
though not among the best, are among the earliest
of that class, and he had the rapt devotion to his Lord
which is ever the inspiration of the true hymn-writer.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">To Thee, my God, my Saviour,</p>
<p class="t">Praise be for ever new;</p>

<br />Nineteenth-century Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c13">I.&mdash;<span class="sc">Anglican Hymns</span></h3>
<p>The hymns of the eighteenth century are almost
without exception by writers of the Dissenting,
Methodist, or Evangelical schools. In
the nineteenth century the tide turns, and though the
Nonconformists are not without hymn-writers of distinction,
the great hymns are by Anglicans. Henry
Francis Lyte in the first half of the century, Bishop
Bickersteth, Charlotte Elliott, and Miss Havergal in
the second, represent the Evangelical school. Heber
was a typical Anglican, but he was not of the Tractarian
type, and died before the publication of the <i>Christian
Year</i>. Keble and Newman were the poets of the Oxford
Movement, and gave a distinctive tone to much of the
later Church hymn-writing; but Heber, more than any
other man, did for the Church of England what Watts
had done for the Nonconformists.</p>
<p>Reginald Heber (1783-1826) was a scholar and a
gentleman, his churchmanship was unimpeachable, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
his life and death alike served to win acceptance for
hymns whose intrinsic worth must have secured the
widest recognition. His hymns, like those of Herbert,
Keble, and many of our sweetest singers, are hymns
of the country parsonage, and seem all to have been
written whilst he held the family living of Hodnet, to
which he was welcomed by the people as &lsquo;Master
Reginald.&rsquo; He was little better satisfied with Tate
and Brady than Watts had been with Barton, and at
one time contemplated using the Olney hymns in his
church. Then he projected a more ambitious scheme,
and hoped, with the help of Milman, Southey, and
Walter Scott, to provide a book which might, perhaps
under episcopal sanction, become the authorized
hymnal of the Church. But he felt the proposal a
bold one, and tried to prepare the way by the publication
in the <i>Christian Observer</i> of a few hymns
which he described as &lsquo;part of an intended series
appropriate to the Sundays and principal holy days of
the year, connected in some degree with their particular
collects and gospels, and designed to be sung between
the Nicene Creed and the sermon.&rsquo; Like other reformers,
he indulges in criticisms of the hymns then in
use, and is especially severe in censuring those which
address our Lord &lsquo;with ditties of embraces of passion.&rsquo;
The hymn-book was duly compiled, and specimens were
submitted to Bishop Howley in the hope that he might
give it an episcopal benediction. It is curious to note
the apologetic tone in which Heber writes.</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_256">256</div>
<p>The evil, indeed, if it be one, of the admission of hymns
into our Churches has, by this time, spread so widely, and
any attempt to suppress it entirely would be so unpopular,
and attended with so much difficulty, that I cannot help
thinking it would be wiser, as well as more practicable, to
<i>regulate</i> the liberty thus assumed, instead of authoritatively
taking it away. Nor can I conceive any method by which
this object might be better obtained than by the publication
of a selection which should, at least, have the praise of
excluding whatever was improper in diction or sentiment;
and might be on this, if on no other ground, thought not
unworthy a licence of the same kind as that which was
given to the psalms of Tate and Brady. I have the
vanity to think that even my own compositions are not
inferior in poetical merit to those of Tate; and my collection
will contain some from our older poets, which it would
be mockery to speak of in the same breath with his. There
are a few also which I have extracted from the popular
collections usually circulated, which, though I have not
been able to learn their authors, possess considerable merit
and much popularity, and are entirely free from objectionable
expressions.<a class="fn" id="fr_171" href="#fn_171">[171]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Bishop criticized freely, generally approved
and advised the completion of the project; but Heber
was called to Calcutta, and the collection was not published
until after his death. It contained fifty-seven
hymns of his own, twelve of Milman&rsquo;s, and twenty-nine
others. His object had been to obtain &lsquo;a well-selected
and sanctioned book of hymns for the Church of
England, to supersede the unauthorized and often very
improper compositions now in use.&rsquo; He did not secure
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
this, but he prepared the way for something better, and
may justly be regarded as the first of the modern
Anglican hymn-writers. His best hymns are too well
known to need comment, and of the rest comparatively
few are of special value in public worship. His hymns
owe more to the inspiration of the Gospels than the
Psalms. The collect or gospel for the day often
explains and throws new light upon a hymn, as in this
for the Second Sunday after Trinity, the gospel being
the Parable of the Great Supper. It is usually regarded
as a Communion hymn.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Forth from the dark and stormy sky,</p>
<p class="t0">Lord, to Thine altar&rsquo;s shade we fly;</p>
<p class="t0">Forth from the world, its hope and fear,</p>
<p class="t0">Saviour, we seek Thy shelter here:</p>
<p class="t0">Weary and weak, Thy grace we pray;</p>
<p class="t0">Turn not, O Lord, Thy guests away!</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Long have we roamed in want and pain,</p>
<p class="t0">Long have we sought Thy rest in vain;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Wildered in doubt, in darkness lost,</p>
<p class="t0">Long have our souls been tempest-tost;</p>
<p class="t0">Low at Thy feet our sins we lay,</p>
<p class="t0">Turn not, O Lord, Thy guests away!</p>
</div>
<p>Henry Hart Milman (1791-1868), who died Dean of
St. Paul&rsquo;s, is famous as an historian rather than a hymn-writer,
but his few hymns have a wide popularity. In</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ride on, ride on in majesty!</p>
</div>
<p>he has shown how fine and true a hymn may be, though
it departs from recognized devotional form. It is
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
a meditation of a highly rhetorical kind, and apostrophizes
but does not address our Lord. By some editors
this is regarded as fatal to its inclusion in a collection
of hymns, but the common judgement of Christian
congregations is right. It has proved itself a hymn in
spite of all rules, and is an excellent spiritual song for
Palm Sunday.</p>
<p>In the year (1827) of the publication of Heber&rsquo;s
<i>Hymns, written and adapted to the Weekly Church Services
of the Year</i>, Keble issued anonymously the most
influential devotional work of the nineteenth century,
<i>The Christian Year: Thoughts in Verse for the
Sundays and Holy Days throughout the Year</i>. Like
Ken&rsquo;s festival hymns, it was not a hymn-book, and
was not meant for use in Church services, though from
a few of the poems verses may be taken which make
hymns of the very best type. Pusey regarded it as
&lsquo;the real source of the Oxford Movement,&rsquo; of which
Newman also thought Keble &lsquo;the true and primary
author,&rsquo; though he &lsquo;ever considered and kept&rsquo; July
14, 1832, the day when Keble preached his sermon
on &lsquo;National Apostasy,&rsquo; &lsquo;as the start of the religious
movement.&rsquo; Of the <i>Christian Year</i> Newman says,
&lsquo;Keble struck an original note, and woke up in the
hearts of thousands a new music, the music of a school
long unknown in England.&rsquo; But the teaching of the
Oxford Movement was rather latent than patent in the
<i>Christian Year</i>, and it would be a great mistake to
regard it as influencing that religious revival or even
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
the English Church alone. On the other hand, Hurrell
Froude feared that the authorship of the <i>Christian Year</i>
would be attributed to a Methodist.<a class="fn" id="fr_172" href="#fn_172">[172]</a> It was as
important an element in the Movement as Charles
Wesley&rsquo;s hymns were in the Evangelical Revival. In
each case the influence extended far beyond those who
claim the poems as their special heritage.</p>
<p>Keble regarded the Church as in a state of desolation,
decay, and apostasy. He knew nothing of the
glorious optimism of the Wesleys, who saw everywhere
signs of the speedy triumph of the gospel and the
coming of Christ&rsquo;s kingdom. They sang</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Plague, earthquake, and famine, and tumult and war,</p>
<p class="t0">The wonderful coming of Jesus declare.</p>
</div>
<p>Keble&rsquo;s vision was</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">So Famine waits, and War with greedy eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">Till some repenting heart be ready for the skies.</p>
</div>
<p>They saw in the ingatherings to their scattered
Societies the assurance of abounding blessing</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lo, the promise of a shower</p>
<p class="t">Drops already from above;</p>
<p class="t0">But the Lord will shortly pour</p>
<p class="t">All the spirit of His love.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_260">260</div>
<p>Keble saw no such visions, dreamed no such dreams.
All he dares to ask is</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, ere our trembling lamps sink down and die,</p>
<p class="t0">Touch us with chastening hand, and make us feel Thee nigh.<a class="fn" id="fr_173" href="#fn_173">[173]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Yet, when he forgets the depression of the time, and
turns to the consolations of eternity, he shows how
firmly he believed his own motto, &lsquo;In quietness and
in confidence shall be your strength.&rsquo; He has the sure
trust and confidence of all God&rsquo;s chosen, and at times
kindles into holy rapture. The prevailing tone, however,
is of sadness&mdash;the depression of the saint, not the
perplexity of the doubter.</p>
<p>In 1839 Keble published, also anonymously, his
metrical version of the Psalms. He had intended it
to be a substitute for Tate and Brady, and had hoped
to secure episcopal sanction for its use in the dioceses
of Oxford and Winchester. It is, however, more
interesting from the standpoint of the expositor than
the hymnologist, very few of its versions being adapted
to congregational use. The <i>Lyra Innocentium</i>, published
anonymously in 1846, is vastly inferior to his
great work, and has little to recommend it to those who
are not in sympathy with the High Church Movement.</p>
<p>After Heber and Keble all that there was of justice
in Montgomery&rsquo;s sarcastic complaint, that hymns had
been written by &lsquo;all sorts of persons except poets&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_174" href="#fn_174">[174]</a> is
<span class="pb" id="Page_261">261</span>
gone. They were poets first, hymn-writers afterwards.
Keble&rsquo;s greatest hymn is taken from his &lsquo;Verses for
Evening,&rsquo; which begins as a poem, and rises from meditation
to praise and prayer. The earlier verses are not
suitable for a hymn-book, but the beauty of the later
lines is only fully realized when they are remembered.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Tis gone, that bright and orb&egrave;d blaze,</p>
<p class="t0">Fast fading from our wistful gaze;</p>
<p class="t0">Yon mantling cloud has hid from sight</p>
<p class="t0">The last faint pulse of quivering light.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In darkness and in weariness</p>
<p class="t0">The traveller on his way must press,</p>
<p class="t0">No gleam to watch on tree or tower,</p>
<p class="t0">Whiling away the lonesome hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,</p>
<p class="t0">It is not night if Thou be near:</p>
<p class="t0">O may no earth-born cloud arise</p>
<p class="t0">To hide Thee from Thy servant&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
</div>
<p>There is surely no more beautiful illustration of the
way in which the Christian rises from Nature up to
Nature&rsquo;s God.</p>
<p>As in the case of so many hymns, the part is greater
than the whole. The six verses universally selected are
not improved by the addition of others&mdash;though they
have much to commend them.</p>
<p>John Henry Newman (1801-90) belongs to Anglican
hymn-writers in virtue of his &lsquo;Lead, kindly Light,&rsquo;
though it may almost be described as his farewell to
the Church of England. It marks at least the beginning
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
of his long-drawn-out parting from the Establishment.
Few hymns have won a wider popularity, and no doubt
it has done much to accustom Nonconformist Churches
to sympathize with the poetic and emotional side of
the Oxford Movement. This hymn and the <i>Christian
Year</i> made absolute want of sympathy with the new
devotion impossible. Moreover, the tone of perplexity,
the confession of bewilderment, the sense of &lsquo;encircling
gloom,&rsquo; fell in with the prevailing spirit of religious
emotion. To many men of his own school the hymn
meant something very different from what it means
to the average worshipper, who finds in it a comfortable
sedative for vague religious depression. I confess that
personally the hymn does not seem to me as great as
its reputation, but it has brought help and comfort
to myriads. Dr. Wm. Barry says&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This most tender of pilgrim songs may be termed the
March of the Tractarian Movement. It is pure melody,
austere yet hopeful, strangely not unlike the stanzas which
Carlyle has made familiar to the whole English race, the
Mason-Song of Goethe, in its sublime sadness and invincible
trust. Both are psalms of life, Hebrew or Northern,
chanted in a clear-obscure where faith moves onward
heroically to the day beyond.<a class="fn" id="fr_175" href="#fn_175">[175]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Newman&rsquo;s other great hymn, &lsquo;Praise to the Holiest
in the height,&rsquo; which owes its popularity largely to
Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s affection for it&mdash;though it is in itself
a fine hymn&mdash;belongs to his Romanist days.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_263">263</div>
<p>There was room for the new teaching. Perhaps
Methodism was a little too buoyant, Evangelicalism
too contented, and the Church was ready for a fresh
upheaval.</p>
<p>Coincidently with the rise of the Oxford Movement
came, as we have seen, the rolling away of the
reproach of hymn-singing. Even the strongholds of
the Establishment capitulated, and hymns formed an
important part in the new propaganda. Stanch
Churchmen had disliked hymn-singing. To quote
Canon Ellerton&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It came to us from an unwelcome source&mdash;from the
Dissenters, eminently from the Methodists. It was first
adopted by those of the clergy who sympathized most with
them; for many long years it was that dreaded thing,
a party badge.<a class="fn" id="fr_176" href="#fn_176">[176]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Evangelicals adopted the custom easily, and
with delight. Cowper, Newton, Toplady, Hervey, Watts,
Doddridge, and even Wesley, were no strangers to them.
But for the Calvinistic trouble, they all minded the
same things. They had no difficulty in regard to
fellowship with Nonconformists in worship or in work.
It has been the fashion to disparage the Evangelicals,
and to regard the &lsquo;Clapham Sect&rsquo; as a coterie of ill-informed,
self-satisfied Pharisees; but for solid, practical
Christianity it would be difficult to find any &lsquo;school&rsquo;
that outrivals them. The &lsquo;Clapham Sect&rsquo; knew little
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
and cared less for priestly rights or the niceties of
ritual. They may have been slack in the observance
of fast and vigil, but they kept the fast of God,
breaking the bonds of wickedness and letting the
oppressed go free. The men who were the backbone
of the anti-slavery movement, who were nursing fathers
to the Bible Society, and established the Church
Missionary Society, were not narrow-minded bigots,
but held the true Catholic Faith concerning the
kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Henry Francis Lyte (1793-1847), whose highest
preferment was the Perpetual Curacy of Lower Brixham,
ranks, as a hymn-writer, with Ken and Keble.
While ministering to his &lsquo;dear fishermen,&rsquo; he wrote
many a lovely hymn, and one of unsurpassed beauty.
&lsquo;Abide with me&rsquo; was his swan-song. He died, like
Toplady, of consumption, and felt the pain and pathos
of death in the prime of life. In a most tender poem
he has recorded that common but infinitely pathetic
grief. It is interesting to contrast the subdued sadness,
the patient submission of Lyte with the triumphant
ecstasy of Toplady&rsquo;s &lsquo;Deathless principle, arise.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Shudder not to pass the stream,</p>
<p class="t0">Venture all thy care on Him.</p>
<p class="t0">Not one object of His care</p>
<p class="t0">Ever suffered shipwreck there.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Saints in glory perfect made</p>
<p class="t0">Wait thy passage through the shade;</p>
<p class="t0">Ardent for thy coming o&rsquo;er,</p>
<p class="t0">See they throng the blissful shore.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_265">265</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Such the prospects that arise</p>
<p class="t0">To the dying Christian&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p class="t0">Such the glorious vista, Faith</p>
<p class="t0">Opens through the shades of death.<a class="fn" id="fr_177" href="#fn_177">[177]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This was the view of death taken by the Evangelicals
in the eighteenth century. The gospel of the great
Revival brought life and immortality to light, robbed
death of all its terrors, and made heaven seem, even
to young men, far better than earth. The nineteenth
century had not the glowing rapture of the earlier
time. Moreover, its interest in works of Christian
philanthropy, its awakening to the great missionary
call, made the life and work of the day infinitely
important and interesting. Christian men began to
realize that heaven lay beyond the golden glory of the
sunset sky, and felt, with those of the older dispensation,
that it was a calamity for the sun to go down
while it was yet day. Lyte felt with Anne Bront&euml;&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I hoped that with the brave and strong</p>
<p class="t0">My portioned task might lie.</p>
</div>
<p>Lyte&rsquo;s sorrow was not that he feared to change the
earthly for the heavenly, but that he longed to have
done enduring work e&rsquo;er the night fell.</p>

<p>Was ever faithful prayer more abundantly answered?
&lsquo;He asked life of Thee, and Thou gavest it,
even length of days for ever and ever.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Christopher Wordsworth (1807-85), Bishop of
Lincoln, nephew of the poet, was of set purpose a
writer of hymns for congregational use. He taught
that hymns should express the feeling of the Church,
and not of the individual worshipper. He thought it
&lsquo;inexpressibly shocking&rsquo; that &lsquo;Jesu, Lover of my soul&rsquo;
should be sung in Westminster Abbey, at least, so I
understand his reference to &lsquo;a large, mixed congregation
in a dissolute part of a populous and irreligious city.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_178" href="#fn_178">[178]</a>
His hymns are objective, and the best&mdash;e.g. &lsquo;O day of rest
and gladness,&rsquo; &lsquo;See the Conqueror mounts in triumph&rsquo;&mdash;are
very fine. Bishop Wordsworth did not &lsquo;translate
any ancient hymns, but attempted to infuse something
of their spirit into&rsquo; his own.</p>
<p>The <i>Holy Year</i> was a distinct contribution to the
literature of the Anglican Revival. Very inferior in
strength and beauty to the <i>Christian Year</i>, it was more
useful to editors of hymn-books, and it helped to
concentrate interest upon the selection of hymns suited
to the Church year. Bishop Wordsworth kept closely
to the Prayer-book ideal of devotion, and some of his
<span class="pb" id="Page_268">268</span>
less-known poems are illustrative of its special teaching.
A good example is the hymn for the Second Sunday
in Advent, which he inscribed, &lsquo;Christ ever coming in
Holy Scripture.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord, who didst the Prophets teach</p>

<p>But the Anglican hymn-writers of the nineteenth
century are too many for detailed comment in my
<span class="pb" id="Page_269">269</span>
fast-failing space. It is a glorious choir, including
Joseph Anstice, who had so powerful an influence over
Mr. Gladstone in his Oxford days;<a class="fn" id="fr_179" href="#fn_179">[179]</a> Dean Alford,
Dr. Monsell, Sir H. W. Baker, Dean Stanley, Bishops
Mant, How, and Bickersteth, Canon Bright, Godfrey
Thring, Canon Ellerton, S. J. Stone, Canon Twells,
Laurence Tuttiett, S. Baring-Gould, among the clergy;
Mrs. Alexander, Charlotte Elliott, Frances Ridley
Havergal, Sir R. Grant, W. Chatterton Dix, among the
laity.</p>
<p>Sir Henry Williams Baker (1821-77) wrote the
lovely sacramental version of Ps. xxiii.: &lsquo;The King of
love my Shepherd is.&rsquo; One verse he repeated with his
dying breath&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,</p>
<p class="t">But yet in love He sought me,</p>
<p class="t0">And on His shoulder gently laid,</p>
<p class="t">And home, rejoicing, brought me.</p>
</div>
<p>He is one of the simplest and most attractive of
hymn-writers, and the inclusion of his hymns in
Nonconformist hymnals is a great gain. His greatest
service to Anglican hymnody was the editing of <i>Hymns
Ancient and Modern</i>&mdash;a truly epoch-making (or perhaps
epoch-marking) book.</p>
<p>While Baker was at work in his Herefordshire
vicarage, John Ellerton (1826-93) was writing hymns
<span class="pb" id="Page_270">270</span>
and essays on hymns in his rural or semi-rural parsonages.
Ellerton had a rare gift in writing for special
occasions. His great funeral hymn, &lsquo;Now the labourer&rsquo;s
task is o&rsquo;er,&rsquo; has a sombre strength which is full of
comfort and trust. &lsquo;Behold us, Lord, a little space&rsquo;
is an ideal hymn for a week-day service, and &lsquo;In the
Name which earth and heaven&rsquo; is the grandest of all
hymns for the laying of the foundation-stone of a
church.<a class="fn" id="fr_180" href="#fn_180">[180]</a> Without being a High-Churchman, Ellerton
was a thorough-going Anglican, and his poetry has the
restraint, the good taste, and the dignity which beseem
a great Church.</p>
<p>S. J. Stone (1839-1900), unlike most clerical
hymn-writers, was not a country parson, though his
best hymns were written before he began his work in
East London. But even in its dreary wastes he found
the true poetry of life, and some of his obscure
parishioners at Haggerston are richly shrined in his
memorial verses. I feel all the more moved by the
triumphant tones of &lsquo;The Church&rsquo;s one foundation,&rsquo;
all the more tenderly impressed by &lsquo;Weary of earth,
and laden with my sin,&rsquo; when I remember how dear
to his heart were the struggling, toiling masses of his
dull East London parish. His best hymns are well

for those who live in the crowded city.</p>

<p>Bishop Bickersteth demands mention, not only for
his own beautiful hymns, but for his successful
editing of the <i>Hymnal Companion to the Book
of Common Prayer</i>. Edward Bickersteth&rsquo;s <i>Christian
Psalmody</i> was, in its day, one of the best and most
catholic hymnals. In the <i>Hymnal Companion</i>, his
son provided for a later generation the more complete
and worthy hymn-book which the growth of hymnody
made possible. Of Bishop Bickersteth&rsquo;s own hymns,
a few are amongst those universally accepted. His
Communion Hymn, to the regret of many, is absent
from the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i>.</p>

<p>This aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s Supper, the proclamation
of the Lord&rsquo;s death &rsquo;till He come,&rsquo; must ever be
present to the mind of the devout communicant. The
hymn&mdash;especially in its last verse&mdash;is full of the
gracious, subdued trustfulness which befits the Christian
as he commemorates the Atoning Sacrifice and looks
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
forward to glad, eternal communion with those who
have gone before, when once again our Lord Himself
shall break the bread and drink the wine with His
disciples in the Father&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Dean Stanley (1815-81) was not a poet, though
he wrote the best English hymn on the Transfiguration.
I mention him here, however, to quote some
verses of his stirring national hymn, worthy of a Dean
of Westminster. It is of a type that, I think, ought to
be represented in our hymnals, and especially those
intended for school use. Why should not such hymns
as this and Mr. Gill&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lift thy song among the
nations&rsquo; stir and consecrate the patriotism of our up-growing
girls and boys? Dean Stanley&rsquo;s hymn is very
long. I quote less than half. In the <i>Westminster
Abbey Hymn-book</i> it is assigned to the Accession.</p>

<p>Of the eighteenth century, Miss Steele and Mrs.
Barbauld are almost the only women whose hymns
survive to-day. In the nineteenth century, however,
there are not a few women whose songs are likely to
endure. Charlotte Elliott, Cecil Frances Alexander,
Anna L&aelig;titia Waring, have written immortal hymns,
and it will be long ere Frances Ridley Havergal is
absent from the songs of the Church. It is safe to
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
prophesy that &lsquo;Just as I am,&rsquo; &lsquo;There is a green hill
far away,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Father, I know that all my life,&rsquo; will
be sung through many generations&mdash;as long, indeed, as
English Christianity endures.</p>
<p>Charlotte Elliott (1791-1871), who belonged to a
famous evangelical Church family, is one of many who
learnt in suffering what she taught in song. Her
greatest hymn, &lsquo;Just as I am,&rsquo; was first published in
the <i>Invalid&rsquo;s Hymn-book</i> (1836), and, without her
knowledge, was reprinted and widely circulated. In
no other hymn has the sinner&rsquo;s way to the Saviour
been made more plain. Through the penitential self-despair
of its earlier verses countless numbers of the
weary and heavy-laden have found rest unto their
souls, and entered into the joyous confidence of its
closing lines. Wordsworth&rsquo;s daughter, Dora, received
the hymn in her last illness, and her husband wrote
to the authoress, &lsquo;At least ten times that day she
asked me to repeat it to her,&rsquo; and every morning she
asked for it again till the end came. After her death
it formed part of her mother&rsquo;s &lsquo;daily solitary prayer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Miss Elliott is the truest and the best representative
of the early evangelical Church hymn-writers.
Many of her little-known hymns are very beautiful.
I quote two pieces, notwithstanding a breath of
Calvinism in them both, for it is a Calvinism that has
good Scripture warrant.</p>

<p>Frances Ridley Havergal (1836-79) was full of
the gladness of God&rsquo;s chosen, and her songs illustrate
Faber&rsquo;s verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If our love were but more simple,</p>
<p class="t">We should take Him at His word,</p>
<p class="t0">And our lives would be all sunshine</p>
<p class="t">In the sweetness of our Lord.</p>
</div>
<p>After her conversion she knew nothing of Wesley&rsquo;s
experience of the &lsquo;howling wilderness&rsquo;; to her the
night was never dark, as it was to Newman, and she
was never far from home. Her hymns overflow with
exultant faith.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_278">278</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sweet bird! thy bower is ever green,</p>
<p class="t">Thy sky is ever clear,</p>

<p class="t">No winter in thy year.<a class="fn" id="fr_183" href="#fn_183">[183]</a></p>
</div>
<p>It would, perhaps, be unsafe to predict that any of
Miss Havergal&rsquo;s hymns will rank among the songs
that cannot die, but they will certainly be long loved
and sung. Her consecration hymns, especially &lsquo;Lord,
speak to me that I may speak,&rsquo; are solemn and impressive,
and are, perhaps, her best. But her triumphant
songs are often very fine, though they are not always
well sustained. Her Advent hymn has the triumphant
rapture of the soul that goes out to meet her Lord.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou art coming, O my Saviour,</p>
<p class="t">Thou art coming, O my King,</p>
<p class="t0">In Thy beauty all-resplendent,</p>

<p class="t">Well may we rejoice and sing;</p>
<p class="t0">Coming! in the opening east</p>

<p class="t0">While remembering hearts Thou meetest</p>
<p class="t0">In communion clearest, sweetest,</p>
<p class="t">Earnest of our coming bliss,</p>
<p class="t0">Showing not Thy death alone,</p>
<p class="t">And Thy love exceeding great,</p>
<p class="t0">But Thy coming and Thy throne,</p>
<p class="t">All for which we long and wait.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_279">279</div>
<p>Cecil Frances Alexander (1823-95) may almost be
called the first writer of real children&rsquo;s hymns.
Dr. Watts was not happy in his <i>Divine and Moral
Songs</i>, and some of Charles Wesley&rsquo;s most horrible
verses are to be found in his <i>Hymns for Children</i>.
It is true that Watts wrote some simple lyrics
which seem to have suited our prim little ancestors,
and that Charles Wesley wrote &lsquo;Gentle Jesus, meek
and mild,&rsquo; but even the manners and beliefs of the
devout souls of that time cannot altogether excuse
some of his hymns, which must have frightened many
a poor little Methodist out of his wits.</p>
<p>Anne and Jane Taylor&rsquo;s <i>Hymns for Infant Minds</i>
are <i>too</i> infantile, though they served their generation
well, and led on from Watts to Mrs. Alexander.
The Taylors had a happy knack of conveying Scripture
history and teaching in simple verse. I do not know
a better definition of repentance than&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Repentance is to leave</p>
<p class="t">The sins I loved before,</p>
<p class="t0">And show that I in earnest grieve</p>
<p class="t">By doing so no more.</p>
</div>
<p>But Mrs. Alexander combines with the winsome
simplicity which charms and instructs a little child,
the power to speak to the child in the heart of the
man. Never has the gospel story been told to children
and to child-like souls more attractively than in &lsquo;Once
in royal David&rsquo;s city&rsquo; and &lsquo;There is a green hill far
away.&rsquo; Since our Church hymnals began to include
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
a section for children, Mrs. Alexander has been a large
contributor. Even yet, when we have a considerable
number of good children&rsquo;s hymns, there are none better
than hers. Of course she wrote other hymns, but these
are her glory, her most precious contribution to the
hymn-book of the modern Church. &lsquo;Her character,&rsquo;
says Archbishop Alexander, &lsquo;was based and moulded
upon the best teaching of the original Oxford movement,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_184" href="#fn_184">[184]</a>
but she had little sympathy with mere
ritualism. Well known and loved as many of her
hymns are, her collected <i>Poems</i> include, among the
less familiar pieces, much of value and interest. She
made for the <i>Irish Church Hymnal</i> a fine translation
of the <i>Breastplate</i> of St. Patrick, a hymn which belongs
to the Celtic, not to the Roman Church.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I bind unto myself to-day</p>
<p class="t">The strong Name of the Trinity,</p>
<p class="t0">By invocation of the same,</p>
<p class="t">The Three in One and One in Three.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I bind unto myself to-day</p>
<p class="t">The power of God to hold and lead,</p>
<p class="t0">His eye to watch, His might to stay,</p>
<p class="t">His ear to hearken to my need.</p>
<p class="t0">The wisdom of my God to teach,</p>
<p class="t">His hand to guide, His shield to ward,</p>
<p class="t0">The word of God to give me speech,</p>
<p class="t">His heavenly host to be my guard.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Christ be with me, Christ within me,</p>
<p class="t">Christ behind me, Christ before me,</p>
<p class="t0">Christ beside me, Christ to win me,</p>
<p class="t">Christ to comfort and restore me,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_281">281</div>
<p class="t0">Christ beneath me, Christ above me,</p>
<p class="t">Christ in quiet, Christ in danger,</p>
<p class="t0">Christ in hearts of all that love me,</p>
<p class="t">Christ in mouth of friend and stranger.<a class="fn" id="fr_185" href="#fn_185">[185]</a></p>
</div>
<p>This hymn is extensively used in Ireland on
St. Patrick&rsquo;s day.</p>
<p>To these hymn-writers we may add the poetesses
Christina G. Rossetti and Jean Ingelow. Miss Rossetti
wrote very little that is really adapted for use in public
worship. There is much, however, to justify the inclusion
in a hymn-book of such verses as, &lsquo;None other Lamb,
none other Name,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_186" href="#fn_186">[186]</a> though they are more fitting for
private prayer than for social worship. The same is
not equally true of Miss Ingelow&rsquo;s poem, &lsquo;And didst
Thou love the race that loved not Thee?&rsquo; for the verses
usually selected form a true hymn. The last verse is&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, lest this heart should, cold and cast away,</p>
<p class="t">Die ere the Guest adored she entertain;</p>
<p class="t0">Lest eyes which never saw Thine earthly day</p>
<p class="t">Should miss Thy heavenly reign.<a class="fn" id="fr_187" href="#fn_187">[187]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Of laymen I can mention only a few names here.
Mr. W. Chatterton Dix has written more good hymns
than those known to our hymn-books. Francis
Turner Palgrave (1824-97), whose <i>Treasury of Sacred
Song</i> is our best anthology, also wrote hymns which, it
seems to me, deserve a wider use than they have
attained. His best-known hymn, without being of
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
the popular type, is of the class which is appreciated
by many in these days of perplexity and unrest.</p>
<div class="verse">

<p>Other hymns by Professor Palgrave are, &lsquo;O thou
not made with hands,&rsquo; &lsquo;Star of morn and even,&rsquo; &lsquo;Thou
that once on mother&rsquo;s knee.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I close this section of my lecture with a few verses
which have, as far as I know, not yet found a place in
any hymnal. They are from a Communion hymn by
Mr. Gladstone. They may rightly be included in the
hymns of the Anglican Revival.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Mr. Gladstone&rsquo;s mind and heart,&rsquo; says Mr. G. W. E.
Russell, &lsquo;were already attuned to the new teaching,
and prepared to receive it, even though he had not
paid much attention to the controversy. It was in
1836 that he wrote his hymn on the Holy Communion.&rsquo;
Mr. Russell gives the following verses&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Here, where Thine angels overhead</p>
<p class="t">Do warn the Tempter&rsquo;s powers away,</p>
<p class="t0">And where the bodies of the dead</p>

</div>
<p>It is at once necessary and almost superfluous to
say that I know how much has been left unsaid, how
many names there are deserving mention, how many
hymns that might be referred to, but in such a fruitful
land the gleanings are richer than the vintage of former
years.</p>

<br />Nineteenth-century Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c14">II.&mdash;<span class="sc">Free Church Hymns</span></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The composing of hymns is one of the surest signs of
spiritual life, and the use of hymns is a wonderful
witness of Christian unity; and the Church of
England has been fertile during the last half-century
in the production of hymns which are used by all
English Christians, whilst the confederate Churches of the
same period can hardly point to any additions made by them
to the hymns of the Christian world.<a class="fn" id="fr_190" href="#fn_190">[190]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As we have seen, the honours of hymn-writing
during the period referred to are undoubtedly with the
Anglicans, though Heber and Keble belong to an earlier
time. But this sweeping assertion of Mr. Llewellyn
Davis ought to have been impossible if he had
remembered Horatius Bonar, certainly one of the
greatest English hymn-writers. There are also George
Rawson, T. T. Lynch, T. H. Gill, George Matheson, and,
every Methodist would add, William M. Bunting.</p>
<p>It must be remembered also that the Free Churches
were already rich in hymns when the nineteenth century
<span class="pb" id="Page_286">286</span>
dawned, whilst the Tractarians had to make, translate,
or borrow from the Nonconformists, hymns for their
special needs. Methodism had an ample supply of
hymns for such Church festivals as it desired, and the
observance of festivals and other ecclesiastical occasions
was only gradually adopted in the older Nonconforming
Churches. When at length they felt the need for such
hymns as form the characteristic portions of Anglican
hymnody they were already to hand; and after the
first natural prejudice against everything that savoured
of the ritualistic movement had passed away, they
found hymns intended to be the exclusive property
of the Anglicans admirably suited to their own newly
awakened Church consciousness. There is something
delightful and even amusing in the readiness with
which such hymns as &lsquo;The Church&rsquo;s one Foundation&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Onward, Christian soldiers&rsquo; have been adopted
by all the denominations. The Baptist and the Bible
Christian sing with as simple confidence as the highest
of Anglicans:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like a mighty army</p>
<p class="t">Moves the Church of God;</p>
<p class="t0">Brothers, we are treading</p>
<p class="t">Where the saints have trod;</p>
<p class="t0">We are not divided,</p>
<p class="t">All one body we,</p>
<p class="t0">One in hope, in doctrine,</p>
<p class="t">One in charity.</p>
</div>
<p>They may have different thoughts as to Apostolic
Succession, but as long as we believe that where
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
Christ is there is the Church such hymns belong
to all.</p>
<p>But though Nonconformity was rich in hymns and
could take without scruple many of the Anglican songs,
the nineteenth century was very far from being altogether
barren in regard to the Free Churches.</p>
<p>Two hymn-writers mark the transition from the
eighteenth to the nineteenth century&mdash;James Montgomery
and Thomas Kelly. They lived, it is true, into
the second half of the last century, but their hymns
are an aftermath of the Evangelical Revival. The later
Oxford Movement did not affect them, and their songs
might all have belonged to the earlier period, save for
the missionary enthusiasm which inspires some of their
best efforts.</p>
<p>James Montgomery (1771-1854) was the son of
a Moravian minister, who died in the West Indies
whilst the poet was at school. He was born at Irvine,
Ayrshire, lived for a time in Ireland, and having been
educated at the Brethren&rsquo;s school at Fulneck, after a few
unsuccessful experiments, settled to work at Sheffield
as assistant to the editor of a local newspaper. He was
a man of strong convictions, and did not hide his light
under a bushel. He was rewarded by two terms of
imprisonment, which he turned to profitable account by
writing poems. His was the usual fate of honest men
persecuted for righteousness&rsquo; sake. Montgomery&rsquo;s name
is one of the chief glories of this city,<a class="fn" id="fr_191" href="#fn_191">[191]</a> where he wrought
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
with head and heart and hand for freedom and for
righteousness. &lsquo;The Climbing Boy&rsquo; is a memorial of his
part in the great philanthropic movements of which
Lord Shaftesbury was the leader. &lsquo;The West Indies&rsquo;&mdash;a
poem which has lines here and there which Cowper
or even William Watson might have written&mdash;celebrates
the time</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">When Wilberforce, the minister of grace,</p>
<p class="t0">The new Las Casas of a ruined race,</p>
<p class="t0">With angel-might opposed the rage of hell,</p>
<p class="t0">And fought like Michael, till the dragon fell.</p>
</div>
<p>&lsquo;Greenland&rsquo; commemorates his inherited love of missions,
and the curious &lsquo;Thoughts on Wheels&rsquo;&mdash;a satire upon
State lotteries&mdash;reminds us that Montgomery anticipated
the <i>Daily News</i> in refusing to insert advertisements
of a &lsquo;national nuisance.&rsquo; We are accustomed to
think of Montgomery as a gracious Moravian poet,
whose most appropriate place was the platform of
a Methodist missionary meeting, but he passed through
storm and tempest, through privation and struggle, to
the peaceful haven of his later years. Montgomery
was a Moravian all his life, a Methodist the greater
part of it, and a Churchman toward the end. Once
again, we may say, &lsquo;Such he was as every Christian
Church would rejoice to have adopted.&rsquo; Indeed,
through its hymn-book, every Church has adopted him,
and in some of the best modern collections Montgomery
is more often heard than Watts.<a class="fn" id="fr_192" href="#fn_192">[192]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_289">289</div>
<p>Montgomery cherished no illusion as to his poetic
powers. He hoped that his <i>Poems</i> might be read for
a generation, but that his <i>Hymns</i> would be his lasting
memorial. &lsquo;The World before the Flood&rsquo; and &lsquo;The
Wanderer in Switzerland&rsquo; are forgotten, and little likely
to be revived; but such hymns as &lsquo;Hail to the Lord&rsquo;s
Anointed&rsquo; and &lsquo;For ever with the Lord&rsquo; will be sung
through the centuries.</p>
<p>The first of these is not only Montgomery&rsquo;s finest
psalm-version, but an unsurpassed rendering of
a triumphant Messianic psalm. It owes something to
the instinctive wisdom with which the best verses have
been selected, and to a few editorial touches.<a class="fn" id="fr_193" href="#fn_193">[193]</a> One can
well imagine the thrill with which it was heard in
Pitt Street Chapel, Liverpool, when the author recited
the hymn at the close of a missionary speech, and how
Adam Clarke rejoiced to add this magnificent rendering
of the 72nd Psalm to his <i>Commentary</i>. It is, I
think, a finer and a much closer rendering of the
&lsquo;Psalm for Solomon&rsquo; than Watts&rsquo;s great version. When
urged by Dr. Clarke to attempt a complete version of
the Psalms, Montgomery said that he feared to touch
the harp of Zion. He did, however, paraphrase
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
about fifty or sixty psalms with more than average
success.</p>
<p>It is sometimes said that &lsquo;Prayer is the soul&rsquo;s sincere
desire&rsquo; is not &lsquo;in the true sense&rsquo; a hymn, but this is
to take too narrow a view of the term. It excellently
illustrates the way in which devout meditation ends in
prayer. Had the last verse been omitted, it would
have been a religious poem, not a hymn, but this throws
upon all that precedes it the light of devotion. Each
verse looks forward to the last&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Thou by whom we come to God,</p>
<p class="t">The Life, the Truth, the Way!</p>
<p class="t0">The path of prayer Thyself hast trod:</p>
<p class="t">Lord! teach us how to pray.</p>
</div>
<p>It is superfluous to refer to all Montgomery&rsquo;s contributions
to our hymn-books, but we must ever gratefully
remember such pieces as his Communion hymn</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">According to Thy gracious word,</p>
</div>
<p>and the solemn prayer</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">In the hour of trial,</p>
<p class="t">Jesus, pray for me,</p>
<p class="t0">Lest by base denial</p>
<p class="t">I depart from Thee.</p>
</div>
<p>It is remarkable that editors should have thought it
necessary to meddle (as indeed Montgomery himself
did) with the second line of this verse, thinking it
&lsquo;unscriptural,&rsquo; although the very word &lsquo;pray&rsquo; is taken
from the lips of our Lord.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_291">291</div>
<p>Montgomery has also given us a fine Christmas
carol&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Angels, from the realms of glory;</p>
</div>
<p>and a solemn meditation on the Passion, Death, and
Resurrection, rising at the last into actual prayer&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Early hasten to the tomb</p>
<p class="t">Where they laid His breathless clay:</p>
<p class="t0">All is solitude and gloom;</p>
<p class="t">Who hath taken Him away?</p>
<p class="t0">Christ is risen! He seeks the skies:</p>
<p class="t0">Saviour, teach us so to rise.</p>
</div>
<p>In Montgomery, as in all great hymn-writers, the
word of Christ dwelt richly, and his songs are full of
the thoughts and phrases of the Psalter and the New
Testament. Some of his sacred poems, though unsuitable
for congregational singing, are good devotional
reading. I quote one such, which seems to me to
deserve something better than the place he gave it in
the Appendix to his <i>Poetical Works</i>.</p>

<p>Thomas Kelly (1769-1854), who was in Ireland
what Williams of Pantycelyn was in Wales, wrote
nearly 800 hymns, the vast majority of which belong to
the same class as the masses of the forgotten hymns
of pious Dissenting pastors in the eighteenth century.
They are often redeemed from absolute dullness only
by his love for curious rhymes, e.g. &lsquo;hers is&rsquo; and
&lsquo;mercies.&rsquo; He illustrates abundantly how easy it is
to have rhyme and rhythm without a suggestion of
poetry, as in this verse&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Spread abroad the joyful sound,</p>
<p class="t">Fly in all directions;</p>
<p class="t0">Speak to all the world around,</p>
<p class="t">Men of all complexions.</p>
</div>
<p>It is amazing that a man who could at times write so
well should, as a rule, write so feebly. Yet Kelly&rsquo;s
hymns have had a great popularity, and a few are firmly
fixed in all our hymn-books. His best are&mdash;&lsquo;Look, ye
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
saints, the sight is glorious,&rsquo; &lsquo;Through the day Thy love
hath spared us,&rsquo; &lsquo;We sing the praise of Him who died,&rsquo;
&lsquo;The Head that once was crowned with thorns,&rsquo; and
that most inspiring and comforting missionary valediction,
&lsquo;Speed Thy servants, Saviour, speed them.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Josiah Conder (1789-1855) was a poet and an
expert editor. His <i>Congregational Hymn-book</i> (1836)
marks a new era in the devotional service of Nonconformity.
He was in some cases a grievous sinner
in regard to alterations, and was often very unhappy
in his emendations.<a class="fn" id="fr_194" href="#fn_194">[194]</a> Some of his original poems are
very beautiful, especially his short hymns and his
versions of Prayer-book collects, e.g. &lsquo;Bread of heaven
on Thee I feed,&rsquo; and the beautiful paraphrase of the
Collect for the Fifth Sunday after Trinity, with which
the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i> closes. Conder belongs to
both centuries. His hymns are often of the dull
didactic type of the earlier time, but he caught something
of the spirit of the later day. Of his longer
hymns the following is a good specimen. It is found
in many hymnals.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">How shall I follow Him I serve?</p>
<p class="t">How shall I copy Him I love?</p>
<p class="t0">Nor from those bless&egrave;d footsteps swerve,</p>
<p class="t">Which lead me to His seat above?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_294">294</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Privations, sorrows, bitter scorn,</p>
<p class="t">The life of toil, the mean abode,</p>

<div class="verse">

</div>
<p>Thomas Toke Lynch (1818-71), an Independent
minister, whose delicate health often interrupted his
labours, published in 1855 a little book of poems
which roused an extraordinary storm. It is difficult
to understand how such an inoffensive book as <i>The
Rivulet</i> could make any great sensation, but the theological
mind was more sensitive, if not more restless,
than it is to-day. The &lsquo;Rivulet Controversy,&rsquo; in which
the redoubtable Dr. John Campbell was the prime
<span class="pb" id="Page_295">295</span>
mover, is long forgotten, but a few of the hymns
survive. The best known is, &lsquo;Gracious Spirit, dwell
with me.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_195" href="#fn_195">[195]</a>
Lynch is an important contributor to Congregational
and Baptist hymnals, but he is practically
unknown to Anglican books, and is not represented in
the <i>Presbyterian Church Hymnary</i>.</p>
<p>Lynch was of the new and broader school of
thought, and his hymns, which he is said to have
designed as a supplement to Watts, are of an entirely
different cast from those of the earlier day, though their
teaching is familiar enough in our time. I make
a brief quotation, which is more likely to be welcome
to-day than it was half a century ago.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If love in any heart arise,</p>
<p class="t0">And stir the tongue, and light the eyes,</p>
<p class="t0">And speed the foot, and fill the hand;</p>
<p class="t0">Then, Christian, thou must understand</p>
<p class="t0">That, though unthought of, God is there;</p>
<p class="t0">So of denying Him beware.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If Little-more makes haste to bless</p>
<p class="t0">His troubled neighbour Little-less,</p>
<p class="t0">And poor men to the poorer give,</p>
<p class="t0">Weak ones the weaker help to live,</p>
<p class="t0">The sad those sadder still console;</p>
<p class="t0">Then God is working in the soul.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_296">296</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If the grown man forgoes his bread</p>
<p class="t0">That little mouths may first be fed;</p>
<p class="t0">And patient women serve the men</p>
<p class="t0">Who care for them but now and then,</p>
<p class="t0">And love keeps warm without a fire;</p>
<p class="t0">O, then, the grace of God admire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Two strangers ocean may divide</p>
<p class="t0">Who yet shall bridegroom be and bride,</p>
<p class="t0">And God unknown to souls may be</p>

<p class="t0">But all true hearts our Father knows,</p>
<p class="t0">And will to them His truth disclose.</p>
</div>
<p>George Rawson (1807-89) has won a wider recognition
than any other English Nonconformist hymn-writer
of the century, except Montgomery. He was
a solicitor in Leeds, and took part in the preparation
of the <i>Leeds Hymn-book</i>. His Communion hymn, &lsquo;By
Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,&rsquo; his Evening hymn,
&lsquo;God the Father, be Thou near,&rsquo; and his Litany of the
Holy Spirit, &lsquo;Come to our poor nature&rsquo;s night,&rsquo; are his
most beautiful contributions to our hymnals, but
several of his less-known poems are bright, simple, and
melodious. His version of Ps. lxxxiv. would have been
better known if Lyte&rsquo;s had not been written.</p>
<p>Thomas Hornblower Gill&rsquo;s (b. 1819) is a very distinct
voice in the choir. He will, I fear, have but
a small place in the hymn-books of the future, though
there is an individuality and force in many of his hymns
which make them singularly attractive. Unfortunately,
he often uses an unusual word or phrase which
diverts the worshipper&rsquo;s mind from what is said to the
<span class="pb" id="Page_297">297</span>
form in which it is expressed. Again, he is too fond of
the epithets &lsquo;dear&rsquo; and &lsquo;sweet,&rsquo; which is the more to be
regretted, as his hymns are never what Wesley called
&lsquo;namby-pambycal,&rsquo; but have a fine, robust tone, and
often a stirring rhythm. He has much of the Puritan
spirit. One of his best hymns, &lsquo;Lord, in the fulness
of my might,&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_196" href="#fn_196">[196]</a> has for its text Cromwell&rsquo;s saying,
&lsquo;How good it is to close with Christ betimes.&rsquo; In the
Congregational and Baptist books Mr. Gill is largely
represented. I hope the inclusion of a few of his
hymns in the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i> will make him
known to a still wider circle. I have marked many
of his hymns for quotation, for they have been dear to
me from my boyhood, when I made acquaintance with
them through George Dawson&rsquo;s hymn-book. Those I
quote are chosen, not because they are specially suitable
for use in public worship, but because there is so
much of force and freshness in both thought and expression.
The hymn on &lsquo;Free Grace&rsquo; has also a motto from
Cromwell&mdash;&lsquo;I have had plentiful wages beforehand,
and I am sure I shall never earn the least mite.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Lord! dost Thou ne&rsquo;er Thy servants bless</p>

<p>A few other hymns by English Nonconformist
writers may be found, some, e.g. Thomas Binney&rsquo;s
&lsquo;Eternal Light,&rsquo; being of a very high order. Mr.
Spurgeon wrote a good many hymns and psalm-versions,
but they are not likely to be widely used.
One, intended as a paraphrase of Ps. xli., might,
perhaps, find a place among hymns of Philanthropy,
where our hymnals are still weak.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, poorest of the poor,</p>

<p>Bernard Barton (1784-1849), the Quaker poet, is
best known by his hymn on the Holy Scriptures&mdash;&lsquo;Lamp
of our feet, whereby we trace.&rsquo; To my mind
<span class="pb" id="Page_301">301</span>
his best hymn is the bright song of the Christian
soldier.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">He who would win a warrior&rsquo;s fame</p>
<p class="t0">Must shun, with ever-watchful aim,</p>
<p class="t2">Entangling things of life;</p>
<p class="t0">His couch the earth, heaven&rsquo;s arching dome</p>
<p class="t0">His airy tent, his only home</p>
<p class="t2">The field of martial strife.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Unwearied by the battle&rsquo;s toil,</p>
<p class="t0">Uncumbered by the battle&rsquo;s spoil,</p>
<p class="t2">No dangers must affright;</p>
<p class="t0">Nor rest seduce to slothful ease,</p>
<p class="t0">Intent alone his chief to please,</p>
<p class="t2">Who called him forth to fight.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Soldier of Christ, if thou wouldst be</p>
<p class="t0">Worthy that epithet, stand free</p>
<p class="t2">From time&rsquo;s encumbering things;</p>

<p>Methodism has not in later days been rich in hymn-writers.
After Thomas Olivers there is but one great
name, that of William M. Bunting (1805-66). Little
as he is known outside his own Church, his hymns are
amongst the best loved and best used in Wesleyan
Methodism. I cannot but think that some day he
will be recognized as one of the glorious choir of the
universal Church. He was an extremely delicate man,
and his natural bent was pensive and self-depreciatory.
He once said to a friend, &lsquo;There is one thing I shall miss
in heaven, the mystic joys of penitence.&rsquo; His great
penitential hymn,</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_302">302</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Holy Spirit! pity me,</p>
<p class="t0">Pierced with grief for grieving Thee,</p>
</div>
<p>even if it be thought too personal for use in public
worship&mdash;I do not think it is&mdash;might well be placed
among hymns for private devotion. In the services of
a minister&rsquo;s &lsquo;quiet day&rsquo; it would be most impressive.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Bless&egrave;d are the pure in heart,</p>
<p class="t0">They have learned the angel art,</p>
<p class="t0">While on earth in heaven to be,</p>
<p class="t0">God, by sense unseen, to see,</p>
</div>
<p>though not a direct prayer, is a long meditation, the
kind of spiritual song which ought to be in all our
hymn-books. His Baptismal hymn is very fine.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O crucified, triumphant Lord!</p>
<p class="t">Thy sceptre and Thy cross we own;</p>
<p class="t0">And, taught by Thine apostle&rsquo;s word,</p>
<p class="t">Repose our faith on Thee alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The sign of faith ordained by Thee</p>
<p class="t">We Thy confessors scorn to shun;</p>
<p class="t0">All men our fellowship shall see,</p>
<p class="t">Our Lord, our faith, our symbol, one.</p>
</div>
<p>It is one of the strongest if not the tenderest of hymns
for infant baptism, and will bear comparison with Dean
Alford&rsquo;s, &lsquo;In token that thou shalt not fear,&rsquo; with this
advantage, that it is not addressed to the infant, but to
Him whose Name is named upon it.</p>
<p>William Morley Punshon&rsquo;s (1824-81) <i>Sabbath
Chimes</i> suffered from comparison with the <i>Christian
Year</i>, but his hymns for Sunday morning and evening&mdash;especially
<span class="pb" id="Page_303">303</span>
the latter&mdash;are not unworthy of a place
amongst the many good hymns we include under this
heading. Both are wisely shortened in hymn-books.
Some readers will be glad to see the following verses
from the Sabbath Evening hymn as they were originally
published, though I do not suggest that the
familiar cento is not better for use in the congregation.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We woke to-day with anthems sweet</p>
<p class="t0">To sing before the mercy-seat,</p>
<p class="t0">And, ere the darkness round us fell,</p>
<p class="t0">We bade the grateful vespers swell.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Whate&rsquo;er has risen from heart sincere,</p>
<p class="t0">Each upward glance of filial fear,</p>
<p class="t0">Each litany, devoutly prayed,</p>
<p class="t0">Each gift upon Thine altar laid;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Each tear, regretful of the past,</p>
<p class="t0">Each longing o&rsquo;er the future cast,</p>
<p class="t0">Each brave resolve,&mdash;each spoken vow,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, our Lord! accept them now.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Whate&rsquo;er beneath Thy searching eyes</p>
<p class="t0">Has wrought to spoil our sacrifice;</p>
<p class="t0">Aught of presumption, over bold,</p>
<p class="t0">The dross we vainly brought for gold;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If we have knelt at alien shrine,</p>
<p class="t0">Or insincerely bowed at Thine,</p>
<p class="t0">Or basely offered blind and lame,</p>
<p class="t0">Or blushed beneath unholy shame;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Or,&mdash;craven prophets,&mdash;turned to flee</p>
<p class="t0">When duty bade us speak for Thee;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">&rsquo;Mid this sweet stillness, while we bow,</p>
<p class="t0">Jesus, our Lord! forgive us now.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_304">304</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, let each following Sabbath yield</p>

<p>The <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i> contains contributions
from several Methodist writers new to our authorized
hymnal. Of those still living I will say nothing,
but I cannot pass over the name of James Smetham
(1821-89), whose tender, solemn lines, &lsquo;While ebbing
nature grieves,&rsquo; though they may rarely be sung in
public, will be prized by many. Another of his hymns
is in a different key. It is, perhaps, more suitable for
congregational use&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Show me, Lord, that Thou art love</p>
<p class="t">In confirmed tranquillity,</p>
<p class="t0">Like the silent sky above,</p>
<p class="t">Let my craving spirit be;</p>
<p class="t0">Dwell in life as vast and still,</p>
<p class="t0">In the sunlight of Thy will.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Thou who fillest all in all,</p>
<p class="t">Knowing that I wander here,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wilt hearken when I call,</p>
<p class="t">I will wait till Thou appear.</p>
<p class="t0">Angels in Thy smile are blest;</p>
<p class="t0">Smile, and Thou wilt give me rest.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">See the lilies of the field!</p>
<p class="t">They are all endued by Thee:</p>
<p class="t0">Thou their innocence wilt shield;</p>
<p class="t">But Thou carest more for me:</p>
<p class="t0">For like summer verdure, I</p>
<p class="t0">Live and grow, but cannot die.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_305">305</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Since on me Thou hast conferred</p>
<p class="t">This dread gift of endless life,</p>
<p class="t0">Let my spirit walk prepared</p>
<p class="t">For its brief and mortal strife;</p>
<p class="t0">Rushing then into Thy breast,</p>
<p class="t0">Thou wilt smile, and I shall rest.</p>
</div>
<p>The weakness of this hymn lies in the word
&lsquo;rushing&rsquo; in the fourth verse, which breaks in upon
the quietness and confidence of the poem.</p>
<p>Mark Guy Pearse has written several good hymns for
children. They are, as Dr. Julian says, &lsquo;of exceptional
merit.&rsquo; Four are in the <i>Methodist Sunday School Book</i>.
His Christmas carol, &lsquo;The fierce wind howls about the
hills,&rsquo; has a quaint, old-world simplicity and ruggedness
that is both picturesque and affecting. His most
carefully wrought hymn is a beautiful song of praise.
The first two lines in each verse are its special charm.
Many readers will be glad to see it here, though it
is well known in Methodist Sunday schools.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Saviour, for Thy love we praise Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Love that brought Thee down to earth;</p>
<p class="t0">Like the angels we would praise Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Singing welcome at Thy birth;</p>
<p class="t2">Let Thy star, through all our gloom,</p>
<p class="t2">Guide us to Thy manger home.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Saviour, for Thy life we praise Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Life that brings us from the dead;</p>
<p class="t0">Like the children we would praise Thee:</p>
<p class="t">Lay Thine hands upon our head.</p>
<p class="t2">Call us, as Thou didst of old,</p>
<p class="t2">Little lambs into Thy fold.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_306">306</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Saviour, for Thy death we praise Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Death that is our hope of life;</p>
<p class="t0">Like the ransomed we would praise Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Who have passed beyond the strife.</p>
<p class="t2">Wash us in Thy cleansing blood,</p>
<p class="t2">Make us kings and priests to God.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Saviour, for Thy love we praise Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Love that lifts us up to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">With the angels let us praise Thee,</p>
<p class="t">Joining in their minstrelsy;</p>
<p class="t2">All our love for ever telling,</p>
<p class="t2">And the mighty chorus swelling,</p>
<p class="t6">Praise the Lord!</p>

<p>Benjamin Gough (1805-77) was a local preacher
and a very minor poet, yet he is not the least of
Methodist hymn-writers. He was an echo, not a voice,
but won much wider acceptance than most of the later
Methodist poets. Dr. Littledale included a number of
his hymns in the <i>People&rsquo;s Hymnal</i>, and he is represented
in several good hymn-books both in this country and
America. His best hymns are &lsquo;Awake, awake, O
Zion&rsquo; and &lsquo;Uplift the blood-stained banner.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Though the English Free Churches are poor
in hymn-writers, the balance is amply redressed in
Scotland. Horatius Bonar (1801-89) is one of the
great singers of the century, and some of his hymns,
e.g. &lsquo;I heard the voice of Jesus say,&rsquo; are surely
immortal. He rightly named his poems &lsquo;hymns of
faith and hope&rsquo;; they look for and haste unto the
coming of the Day of Christ. His Communion hymn,
&lsquo;Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face,&rsquo; and &lsquo;A few
<span class="pb" id="Page_307">307</span>
more years shall roll,&rsquo; with some others, are in all
great collections. Few modern books have less than
ten of his hymns, and many have from twelve to
twenty. He was also a successful translator, though
his fame rests on his original hymns. If I quote
few of his verses, it is only because they are so well
known. The Second Advent filled a large place in
his thought and teaching. The following lines, to
which he prefixed a quotation from St. Augustine,
&lsquo;The world has grown old,&rsquo; are very characteristic&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Lord, and tarry not,</p>
<p class="t">Bring the long-looked-for day;</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, why these years of waiting here,</p>
<p class="t">These ages of delay?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, for Thy saints still wait,</p>
<p class="t">Daily ascends their sigh;</p>
<p class="t0">The Spirit and the Bride say, Come:</p>
<p class="t">Dost Thou not hear the cry?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, for creation groans,</p>
<p class="t">Impatient of Thy stay,</p>
<p class="t0">Worn out with these long years of ill,</p>
<p class="t">These ages of delay.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, for Thy foes are strong;</p>
<p class="t">With taunting lip they say,</p>
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Where is the promised advent now,</p>
<p class="t">And where the dreaded day?&rsquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, for love waxes cold,</p>
<p class="t">Its steps are faint and slow;</p>
<p class="t0">Faith now is lost in unbelief,</p>
<p class="t">Hope&rsquo;s lamp burns dim and low.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_308">308</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, for the corn is ripe;</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, and make all things new,</p>

<p>Fewer and less easily adapted to congregational
use are the sacred songs of Dr. George Matheson,
whose best-known hymn is probably the most widely
appreciated of any written in the last quarter of a
century. It must be familiar to most readers, but as
it is not found in the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i>, I give it
here&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Love that wilt not let me go,</p>
<p class="t">I rest my weary soul on Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">I give Thee back the life I owe,</p>
<p class="t0">That in Thine ocean depths its flow</p>
<p class="t">May richer, fuller be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Light that followest all my way,</p>
<p class="t">I yield my flickering torch to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">My heart restores its borrowed ray,</p>
<p class="t0">That in Thy sunshine&rsquo;s blaze its day</p>
<p class="t">May brighter, fairer be.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_309">309</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Joy that seekest me through pain,</p>
<p class="t">I cannot close my heart to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">I trace the rainbow through the rain,</p>
<p class="t0">And feel the promise is not vain</p>
<p class="t">That morn shall tearless be.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O Cross that liftest up my head,</p>
<p class="t">I dare not ask to fly from Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">I lay in dust life&rsquo;s glory dead,</p>
<p class="t0">And from the ground there blossoms red</p>
<p class="t">Life that shall endless be.</p>
</div>
<p>Very different are his verses on Brotherhood, which
are not on the ordinary lines of a hymn, but make an
excellent song for a gathering of working-men, for a
temperance meeting, or for &lsquo;united&rsquo; gatherings of
many kinds. It is at least thoroughly modern.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, let us raise the common song&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Day&rsquo;s beams are breaking;</p>
<p class="t0">Shadows have parted hearts too long,</p>
<p class="t">Light in the east is waking.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, let us clasp united hands&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Love&rsquo;s rays are falling;</p>
<p class="t0">Sea too long divides the lands,</p>
<p class="t">Kindred claims are calling.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, let us lift a common prayer&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">One hope combines us;</p>

<p class="t">Mutual grief refines us.</p>

<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, let us lift our brother&rsquo;s load&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Christ&rsquo;s cross is o&rsquo;er us;</p>

<p class="t">When Heaven&rsquo;s is seen before us.</p>

<p>Dr. Walter C. Smith&rsquo;s is not a familiar name in our
hymn-books. Only editors who are willing to leave
the beaten track will find his poems &lsquo;true hymns.&rsquo;
The <i>Baptist Church Hymnal</i>, which is perhaps the most
catholic and the most literary of our modern books,
gives six of his hymns, while the Presbyterian and the
Methodist have none. But many of his poems are good
hymns, though perhaps they appeal to a limited circle.
His <i>Thoughts and Fancies for Sunday Evenings</i> has
long stood close to my study chair, and I do not think
there is any book (except George Herbert) I have so
often read after the day&rsquo;s work is done. His hymns
have the true patience and the happy trustfulness
which are the strength and inspiration of Christian
service. Here are three verses from the poem on
Ps. cxviii. 1&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Why should I always pray,</p>
<p class="t">Although I always lack?</p>
<p class="t0">Were &rsquo;t not a better way</p>
<p class="t">Some praise to render back?</p>
<p class="t0">The earth that drinks the plenteous rain</p>
<p class="t0">Returns the grateful cloud again.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_311">311</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">We should not get the less</p>
<p class="t">That we remembered more</p>
<p class="t0">The truth and righteousness</p>
<p class="t">Thou keep&rsquo;st for us in store:</p>
<p class="t0">In heaven they do not pray&mdash;they sing,</p>
<p class="t0">And they have wealth of everything.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And it would be more meet</p>
<p class="t">To compass Thee with song,</p>
<p class="t0">Than to have at Thy feet</p>
<p class="t">Only a begging throng,</p>
<p class="t0">Who take Thy gifts and then forget</p>
<p class="t0">Alike Thy goodness and their debt.</p>
</div>
<p>My next quotation is well worthy of a place beside
Bishop Bickersteth&rsquo;s &lsquo;Come ye yourselves apart,&rsquo;
and with the most impressive and consoling of hymns
for Christian workers.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oft, Lord, I weary in Thy work,</p>
<p class="t">But of Thy work I do not tire,</p>
<p class="t0">Although I toil from dawn till dark,</p>
<p class="t0">From matins of the early lark</p>
<p class="t">Until his even-song expire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Ah! who that tends the altar fire,</p>
<p class="t">Or ministers the incense due,</p>
<p class="t0">Or sings Thy praises in the choir,</p>
<p class="t0">Or publishes good news, could tire</p>
<p class="t">Of that he loves so well to do?</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sweet is the recompense it brings&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">The work that with good-will is done;</p>
<p class="t0">For all the heart with gladness sings,</p>
<p class="t0">And all the fleeting hours have wings,</p>
<p class="t">And all the day is full of sun.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_312">312</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And if he labour not in vain,</p>
<p class="t">If souls are by his message stirred,</p>
<p class="t0">If he can comfort grief and pain,</p>
<p class="t0">Or bring repentant tears like rain</p>
<p class="t">By force of his entreating word,</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">The hand may weary at its task,</p>
<p class="t">And weary he may drag his feet;</p>
<p class="t0">The weary frame may long to bask</p>
<p class="t0">In needful rest; but do not ask</p>
<p class="t">The heart to weary of its beat.</p>
</div>
<p>To these quotations&mdash;and they are few compared
with those I would like to make&mdash;I must add Dr. Smith&rsquo;s
singularly solemn and beautiful prayer, which in the
<i>Baptist Church Hymnal</i> is appointed for the close of the
Communion Service. It is unique among sacramental
hymns.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If any to the feast have come</p>
<p class="t">Who were not bidden, Lord, forgive;</p>
<p class="t0">They were not of our Father&rsquo;s home,</p>
<p class="t">Yet in Thy mercy let them live.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">If any came in doubt or fear,</p>
<p class="t">O may they carry peace away;</p>
<p class="t0">Let heaven to them be calm and clear,</p>
<p class="t">Still brightening to the perfect day.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">And who in Zion mourning were,</p>
<p class="t">O give them songs of praise to Thee;</p>
<p class="t0">And who were full of anxious care,</p>
<p class="t">O set them from their burden free.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All those who never sat before</p>
<p class="t">At this dear table of Thy grace,</p>

<p>From these great Scotch hymn-writers I turn for
a moment to the Unitarian contribution to the
Church&rsquo;s hymn-book. Here it must be said that the
best comes to us from America, where the Unitarians
claim Oliver Wendell Holmes, James Russell Lowell,
Samuel Longfellow, and Samuel Johnson. In England
we have Sir John Bowring (1792-1872); and Sarah
Flower Adams (1805-48), whose &lsquo;Nearer, my God, to
Thee&rsquo; has a sure place among the best-loved hymns.
Mrs. Adams also wrote two beautiful little hymns
suited for the close of service, each beginning, &lsquo;Part
in peace,&rsquo; and was an important contributor to
W. J. Fox&rsquo;s <i>Hymns and Anthems</i> for the use of
the South Place Religious Society, one of the most
curious of modern hymnals. Mr. Page Hopps has
written some good hymns, which are widely used.
His child&rsquo;s prayer, &lsquo;Father, lead me day by day,&rsquo;
is beautiful in its strong simplicity. Dr. James
Martineau wrote a few hymns which I cannot but
think are included in evangelical hymn-books more
out of respect for their author than for their actual
<span class="pb" id="Page_314">314</span>
devotional or poetic value. The best known is &lsquo;Thy
way is in the deep, O Lord.&rsquo; I quote one less often
found&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&lsquo;Where is your God?&rsquo; they say:</p>
<p class="t">Answer them, Lord most holy!</p>
<p class="t0">Reveal Thy secret way</p>
<p class="t">Of visiting the lowly:</p>
<p class="t2">Not wrapped in moving cloud,</p>
<p class="t3">Or nightly-resting fire;</p>
<p class="t2">But veiled within the shroud</p>
<p class="t3">Of silent high desire.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come not in flashing storm,</p>
<p class="t">Or bursting frown of thunder:</p>
<p class="t0">Come in the viewless form</p>
<p class="t">Of wakening love and wonder;&mdash;</p>
<p class="t2">Of duty grown divine,</p>
<p class="t3">The restless spirit, still;</p>
<p class="t2">Of sorrows taught to shine</p>
<p class="t3">As shadows of Thy will.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O God! the pure alone,&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">E&rsquo;en in their deep confessing,&mdash;</p>

<br />Nineteenth-century Hymns</h2>
<h3 id="c15">III.&mdash;<span class="sc">Roman Catholic Hymns</span></h3>
<p>English Romanism has shared in the revival
of hymnody, and has been greatly enriched
by the men who, to quote Mr. Moorsom&rsquo;s
delightful record of Faber, &lsquo;left the Church of England
for the Roman schism in England.&rsquo; From Austin to
Faber, Romanism has hardly any English hymn-writers.
Some of the Latin hymns by English writers
have an alluring rhythm, the ideal tone of a Christmas
carol. It is easy to understand how popular they
might be in the vernacular. Here is a bright lilting
verse from a thirteenth-century hymn:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Gabriel to Mary went,</p>
<p class="t">A mighty message bare he;</p>
<p class="t0">Deep in awe the maiden bent</p>
<p class="t">To hear the first Hail Mary!<a class="fn" id="fr_201" href="#fn_201">[201]</a></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_316">316</div>
<p>Richard Crashaw (d. 1650) was a poet, but scarcely
a hymn-writer, though from his &lsquo;Hymn of St. Thomas&rsquo;
a good cento may be made.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">With all the powers my poor heart hath</p>
<p class="t0">Of humble love and loyal faith,</p>
<p class="t0">Thus low, my hidden Life, I bow to Thee,</p>
<p class="t0">Whom too much love hath bowed more low for me.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Faith is my force: Faith strength affords</p>
<p class="t0">To keep pace with Thy powerful words,</p>
<p class="t0">And words more sure, more sweet than they,</p>
<p class="t0">Love could not think, Truth could not say.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Help, Lord, my faith, my hope increase,</p>
<p class="t0">And fill my portion in Thy peace:</p>
<p class="t0">Give love for life; nor let my days</p>
<p class="t0">Grow but in new powers to Thy praise.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O dear memorial of that Death,</p>
<p class="t0">Which lives still and allows us breath!</p>
<p class="t0">Rich, royal food! Bountiful bread!</p>
<p class="t0">Whose use denies us to the dead.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, Love! come, Lord! and that long day</p>
<p class="t0">For which I languish, come away!</p>
<p class="t0">When glory&rsquo;s sun faith&rsquo;s shades shall chase,</p>
<p class="t0">And for Thy veil give me Thy face.<a class="fn" id="fr_202" href="#fn_202">[202]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Robert Southwell (d. 1595) did not write so good
a hymn as this, but several of his very striking poems
are included in the Arundel book&mdash;&lsquo;The Burning Babe,&rsquo;
&lsquo;New Prince, new Pomp,&rsquo; &lsquo;A Child my choice.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Early in the nineteenth century efforts were made to
<span class="pb" id="Page_317">317</span>
provide English hymn-books for Romanists. Father
Haydock (1823) even adapted some of the hymns of
Wesley, Watts, Montgomery, and other Protestants,
but the effort does not seem to have been appreciated.<a class="fn" id="fr_203" href="#fn_203">[203]</a></p>
<p>Frederick William Faber (1814-63) did for English
Romanists what Watts had done for Nonconformists
more than a hundred years earlier. He is the Watts
and Wesley of Romanism. Faber &lsquo;went over&rsquo; in
1846, after a brief ministry in the Anglican Church.
He lamented that Catholics had not &lsquo;the means
of influence which one school of Protestantism has
in Wesley&rsquo;s, Newton&rsquo;s, and Cowper&rsquo;s hymns, and
another in the more refined and engaging works of
Oxford writers.&rsquo; As &lsquo;an English son of St. Philip&rsquo;
Neri, he claimed to be following in the steps of
that &lsquo;right merry saint&rsquo; in his attempt to provide
&lsquo;English Catholic hymns fitted for singing.&rsquo; &lsquo;St. Philip
devised a changeful variety of spiritual exercises and
recreations, which gathered round him the art and
literature, as well as the piety of Rome, and was
eminently qualified to meet the increased appetite for
the word of God, for services in the vernacular, for
hymn-singing and prayer-meetings.&rsquo; These last words
have a fine Methodist flavour, and increase one&rsquo;s
sympathy with their writer. But it must be admitted
that Faber was a thorough-going Romanist. He
believed that &lsquo;God raised up our dear and blessed
Father, St. Philip ... just as the heresy of Protestantism
<span class="pb" id="Page_318">318</span>
was beginning to devastate the world.&rsquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_204" href="#fn_204">[204]</a> Faber&rsquo;s
hymns must not be judged simply by our Protestant
versions, but we may be thankful that he gave a new
and better tone to the hymn-singing of the Roman
Church. His best hymns, with their exquisite yearning
tenderness, are so dear to us that there is no need to
speak of them; they speak the language of the Christian
heart, and he who sings thus sings the Holy Spirit&rsquo;s song.</p>
<p>It must be admitted, however, that we have taken
the best of Faber into our hymnals, and the residue is
not&mdash;from the Protestant standpoint&mdash;of great value.
What one may call the lighter songs of Roman Catholic
psalmody are so little known to us that I quote, as a
favourable illustration of a class of hymn that bulks
largely in Romanist books, two verses of Faber&rsquo;s song
for St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day. One can readily imagine that
such a hymn would be popular in Ireland, and serve
to keep alive the legend of St. Patrick.</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">All praise to Saint Patrick who brought to our mountains</p>
<p class="t">The gift of God&rsquo;s faith, the sweet light of His love!</p>
<p class="t0">All praise to the shepherd who showed us the fountains</p>
<p class="t">That rise in the heart of the Saviour above!</p>
<p class="t5">For hundreds of years,</p>
<p class="t5">In smiles and in tears,</p>
<p class="t0">Our saint hath been with us, our shield and our stay;</p>
<p class="t5">All else may have gone,</p>
<p class="t5">Saint Patrick alone,</p>
<p class="t0">He hath been to us light when earth&rsquo;s lights were all set,</p>
<p class="t">For the glories of faith they can never decay;</p>
<p class="t0">And the best of our glories is bright with us yet,</p>
<p class="t">In the faith and the feast of Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_319">319</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">There is not a saint in the bright courts of Heaven</p>
<p class="t">More faithful than he to the land of his choice;</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, well may the nation to whom he was given,</p>
<p class="t">In the feast of their sire and apostle rejoice!</p>
<p class="t5">In glory above,</p>
<p class="t5">True to his love,</p>
<p class="t0">He keeps the false faith from his children away:</p>
<p class="t5">The dark false faith,</p>
<p class="t5">That is worse than death,</p>
<p class="t0">Oh, he drives it far off from the green sunny shore,</p>
<p class="t">Like the reptiles which fled from his curse in dismay;</p>
<p class="t0">And Erin, when error&rsquo;s proud triumph is o&rsquo;er,</p>
<p class="t">Will still be found keeping Saint Patrick&rsquo;s Day.</p>
</div>
<p>Edward Caswall (1814-78), who resigned his Anglican
living in 1847, was received into the Roman
Church in 1850. He is a more successful translator
than composer, his best original hymn being &lsquo;Days and
moments quickly flying.&rsquo; His translations from the
Latin and German are in all our hymnals.</p>
<p>Romish hymnals contain many prayers for the reconversion
of England. There is something pathetic in
such lines as these in a hymn of Father Potter&rsquo;s&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh! yet once more, o&rsquo;er English fields,</p>
<p class="t">The glorious Cross shall wave;</p>
<p class="t0">The solace of the broken heart,</p>
<p class="t">The standard of the brave.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Oh, isle of Saints! oh, Mary&rsquo;s dower!</p>
<p class="t">How long ere this shall be?</p>
<p class="t0">When wilt thou rise, throw off thy chains,</p>
<p class="t">And once again be free?</p>
</div>
<p>But if our Romish brethren sing thus, why should not
<span class="pb" id="Page_320">320</span>
we teach our children Mr. Gill&rsquo;s stirring hymn, which
includes the lines</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Sing how He His England crown&egrave;d,</p>
<p class="t">When He loosed the yoke of Rome?</p>
</div>
<p>Have we not as good cause for praise as they for
prayer?</p>
<p>One turns from the study of Romish hymn-books
with a sense of having travelled in a far country, where
yet there is much to remind one of the home-land.
There is a great gulf, as we thankfully acknowledge,
between even the High Anglican and the Romanist&mdash;a
considerable portion of the Romish hymn-book is,
and we trust ever will be, impossible to the bulk of
English Christians. On the other hand, one can neglect
the chaff and gather golden grain, for saintly Romanists
have a genius for devotion. It is much to be wished
that the readiness with which we have adopted hymns
from Roman Catholic sources had been reciprocated.
But almost all the great English hymns are missing
from Catholic hymnals. The Arundel editors admit
translations by Dr. Neale, and even Miss Winkworth,
but no original hymns save those by writers of their
own faith. Mr. Tozer, in his <i>Catholic Hymns</i>, includes
Charlotte Elliott&rsquo;s &lsquo;Thy Will be done,&rsquo; and gives the
author&rsquo;s name, but I am afraid he did not know she was
a Protestant&mdash;though I hope he did.</p>
<p>Naturally, Faber and Caswall are the chief contributors;
and books that contain their hymns and
those of Matthew Bridges, Adelaide Anne Procter, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_321">321</span>
J. H. Newman, cannot be without much spiritual wealth.
The two collections I have named give a very hopeful
impression concerning the future of Roman Catholic
hymnody; though they are practically innocent of
Protestant hymns, they contain many which are
Catholic, and not Roman. Indirectly, the use of such
books must prepare the way for a greater freedom
in worship and a nearer approximation to the general
company of believers.</p>
<p>I will close this slight sketch with two verses by
Cardinal Manning:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Death has for me no fears; its bitter pains</p>
<p class="t">Shall never from my King my heart divide:</p>
<p class="t0">Faithful to Him till death my will remains;</p>
<p class="t">I nothing fear, with Jesus at my side.</p>
</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Jesus, my Lord! my only hope and shield;</p>
<p class="t">No powers of ill before Thee can abide;</p>
<p class="t0">I trust in Thee upon the battlefield;</p>
<p class="t">I nothing fear, with Jesus at my side!<a class="fn" id="fr_205" href="#fn_205">[205]</a></p>
</div>
<p>Here our study must perforce break off, for the
limits assigned to my lecture have been already exceeded.
Several important subjects must be omitted.
American hymns take a comparatively inconspicuous
place in our Church hymnals, but have a large space
in collections of songs for mission services and undenominational
gatherings.</p>
<p>Translations from the Greek, Latin, and German
furnish many of our finest and most popular hymns.
<span class="pb" id="Page_322">322</span>
In regard to modern hymn-books, the German are the
older, and indeed many of the Latin hymns are
actually of a later date than those of Luther and
even Paul Gerhardt. John Wesley&rsquo;s intercourse with
the Moravians introduced him to the German hymns,
and his translations are almost as important a feature
in our hymn-books as Charles Wesley&rsquo;s original compositions.
Miss Winkworth&rsquo;s <i>Lyra Germanica</i> is
one of the great devotional works of the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>The Oxford Movement drew attention to the hymns
of the Greek and Roman Churches, and <i>Hymns Ancient
and Modern</i> popularized many hymns suitable to the
worship of all the Churches. Bishop Mant, Isaac
Williams, Edward Caswall, and Dr. Neale led the way
in translating these hymns into English verse, and they
quickly secured a large place in hymn-books. Not
only have they great historic interest, but they give
us some of the sublimest and the sweetest of our hymns
of penitence and praise, ranging from the solemn tones
of the &lsquo;Dies irae&rsquo; to the lovely lyrics of Bernard of
Clairvaux, &lsquo;Jesu, the very thought of Thee.&rsquo; No survey
of the hymn-book of the modern Church can be complete
without reference to them, but I am compelled
to pass them by with only this brief mention.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_323">323</div>
<h2 id="ch16"><span class="h2line1">CONCLUSION</span></h2>
<p>Our study of English hymns has carried us
through three centuries and a half&mdash;from
the rough, halting lines of Coverdale to
the smooth and easy rhythm of the hymn-writers of
to-day.</p>
<p>From Sternhold and Hopkins to the modern hymn-book
is a long and delightful journey. &lsquo;I envy not in
any mood&rsquo; the man who finds in devotional poetry only
matter for criticism. If it be true that the heart makes
the theologian, it is more true that the heart makes
the hymnologist.</p>
<p>The earlier stages of our study may yield little
actual fruit in the shape of hymns which a modern
editor would delight to add to his hymn-book. But it
yields much in the way of inspiration, bringing us into
communion with men like Herbert, Donne, Sandys,
Vaughan, and, in his measure, Wither&mdash;men who might
have lived the courtier&rsquo;s life had they not chosen to
serve the King of kings. So far as their poems are
concerned, it is a mere accident that Herbert and
Donne were in orders. They are not clerical hymn-writers,
but, like others of their school, are poets of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_324">324</span>
inner and individual life. They touch our hearts, not
because they have written what expresses the common
need of a congregation, but because they speak in
graceful form what most of us can feel but could
never put into words. Campion and the two Austins
represent the devout laymen of the professional class&mdash;men
who might, if they pleased, have been mere
men of the world. It would be quite possible to
discuss English hymns with scarce a mention of such
names, but, it seems to me, that in losing them our
study would lose its richest charm.</p>
<p>Ken may be considered the first of the Anglican,
Mason of the Evangelical, and Watts of the Dissenting
hymn-writers. They wrote, not simply for their own
delight or relief, but for the sake of others. Ken
had no immediate successors, though he is the founder
of the school of Heber, Lyte, Keble, and Ellerton.
Mason&rsquo;s immediate successors were Shepherd, Newton,
and Cowper; Watts was the first of a long succession
of the later Puritans.</p>
<p>It is usual to call the eighteenth century the golden
age of hymn-writing; but I am not sure that this will
be the final verdict. I confess that in many respects I
find both the earlier and the later period more attractive.
If we leave out of the account Wesley&rsquo;s hymns,
many of which owe their long use in the Methodist
Churches to other than poetic considerations, the vast
majority of the eighteenth-century hymns have disappeared
from modern use. It is interesting to compare
<span class="pb" id="Page_325">325</span>
the hymn-books of 1750-1850 with those issued within
the last twenty years. Rippon&rsquo;s <i>Selection</i>, in its
various editions; Collyer&rsquo;s <i>Hymns</i>; Dobell&rsquo;s <i>New
Selection of Nearly Eight Hundred Evangelical Hymns</i>;
Bickersteth&rsquo;s <i>Christian Psalmody</i>; and Snepp&rsquo;s <i>Songs
of Grace and Glory</i>, compared with the most recent
hymn-books, show not only what great additions have
been made to the treasury of Christian song, but how
many hymns once regarded as almost indispensable are
now forgotten, and are never likely to be revived.
The formal, didactic, preaching hymns, so popular a
hundred years ago, have been steadily losing ground.
They not only fail to touch the heart of present-day
worshippers, they have no element of distinction,
nothing that could or should give them a permanent
place in the songs of the Church of Christ. Hymns
of the period before Watts are much more common
in twentieth-century hymn-books than in those of
the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, but the hymns
characteristic of the eighteenth century are rapidly
disappearing. They were written to meet the needs
of the Dissenting meeting-house and the Evangelical
Revival. But among them are many which voice the
experience, &lsquo;not of an age, but of all time&rsquo;; they
speak the language of the soul that seeks and finds and
follows the Saviour.</p>
<p>Nineteenth-century hymns were largely affected by
the great Anglican Revival&mdash;a much wider term than &lsquo;the
Oxford Movement.&rsquo; The best known and loved of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_326">326</span>
hymns of the last eighty years are those which, in one
way or other, emphasize the idea of the Church,
which help the worshipper to realize that he belongs to
that Holy Church which, throughout all the ages and
in all lands, acknowledges God to be the Lord. It
is one of the unexpected and undesired fruits of the
Anglican Revival that every denomination now claims
its place in an undivided Church. The longing for
unity which led the Tractarians first to look and then
to move toward Rome, led the Free Churches to reconsider
their own position, and to seek for a larger and
more scriptural conception of the Church. A narrow
Calvinism had, on the one hand, kept many coldly
isolated from their brethren; and, on the other, a narrow
fervour, a too literal belief that Methodism, and
Methodism alone, was Christianity in earnest, made
others keep themselves warm by their own firesides,
under the impression that their neighbours sat by cold
hearths or crouched over smouldering embers. For
this estrangement of brethren, the earlier hymn-books
are to some extent responsible. The spirit of Christian
charity, of genial mutual appreciation, has wonderfully
developed since denominational hymn-books became
shining evidences of unity in diversity. Some of
Wesley&rsquo;s earlier hymn-books illustrate this, and it is
to be regretted that he did not make a more liberal
use of the work of other men when he issued his
final hymn-book for the people called Methodists. The
earliest great catholic Collection with which I am
<span class="pb" id="Page_327">327</span>
acquainted is the Moravian book of 1754.<a class="fn" id="fr_206" href="#fn_206">[206]</a> Disfigured
as it is by a number of the bad Moravian hymns, it
yet deserves a place&mdash;considering the time at which it
was issued&mdash;beside Palgrave&rsquo;s <i>Treasury of Sacred Song</i>.
It was a by no means unsuccessful effort to do for
the Moravians of the mid-eighteenth century what the
<i>Methodist Hymn-book</i> has done for our own Church at
the beginning of the twentieth century. It gathers
into one volume most of the best hymns of other
Churches, while preserving those peculiarly suited to
the needs and tastes of its own members.</p>
<p>In this regard the hymn-books of the Methodist
and of the Anglican Church represent a different type
from those of the principal Nonconformist Churches.
The latter include very little that is distinctive
of the Churches for whose use they are prepared.
Where they differ it is usually a matter of taste, not of
doctrine. The Presbyterian, Baptist, and Congregational
books might be used by any or all of these Churches.
And there is much to be said in defence of the elimination
of denominational characteristics.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there is, I believe, more to be
said in favour of the hymn-book which is designed
to aid the Church in its specific work and teaching.
It would be impossible to exaggerate the influence of
Wesley&rsquo;s <i>Hymns</i> upon the Methodist Churches. And
<span class="pb" id="Page_328">328</span>
there can be no question that <i>Hymns Ancient and
Modern</i> has had an immense influence, both for
good and ill, upon the Anglican Revival. It was
originally issued in 1861, when the Movement was
taking firm hold of the clergy, and beginning to change
the whole tone of the teaching and the whole spirit of
public worship in hundreds of parishes. Its success
was enormous, only paralleled by that of Watts and
Wesley. The title was in itself a confession of faith
in the new Movement. The first edition was, in
comparison with the popular hymnals of the Evangelicals,
a marked advance toward High Church
worship; but it is very modest and tentative when
compared with its latest edition. I say nothing
of its doctrine, for I have no space for criticism.
I commend the principle upon which the work was
done&mdash;the education of the worshipper in the faith
and practice which the compilers believed to be most
truly in accordance with the Divine ideal of the
Church.</p>
<p>On the same general principle the <i>Methodist Hymn-book</i>
has been compiled. It is made, not for other
people, but for ourselves. Some friendly critics see,
&lsquo;with a scornful wonder,&rsquo; the number of Charles
Wesley&rsquo;s hymns which still survive, and talk of
superstitious reverence for a name. But they do
not understand that these hymns, perhaps especially
those which are unknown to other Churches, enshrine
what we regard as most precious in Methodist life
<span class="pb" id="Page_329">329</span>
and teaching. From a literary or poetic point of view,
it may be that our hymn-book is inferior to the
Baptist, the Presbyterian, and the Congregational, and
perhaps especially to such a book as Mr. Horder&rsquo;s
<i>Worship-Song</i>. But the hymn-book of a living,
working Church should not be constructed on purely
literary lines. It is not a treasury of religious poetry,
not a sacred anthology, but a book of common prayer
and praise, for use in particular congregations.</p>
<p>Next to <i>Hymns Ancient and Modern</i> the most
influential of nineteenth-century hymn-books is <i>Sacred
Songs and Solos</i>, the chief memorial of the mission of
Moody and Sankey. They introduced the lighter
ephemeral songs which suited large undenominational
gatherings, and caught the ear and reached the heart
of the man and the child in the street. I cannot
regret that few of these ditties find their way
into Church hymnals; yet I am not ashamed to admit
that in many an East End meeting I have been thankful
for &lsquo;Sankey&rsquo;s Hymns.&rsquo; In any review of English
hymns this popular collection cannot be overlooked.</p>
<p class="tb">I have spoken of the advantage of diversity in
Church hymnals, but there remains a further and very
interesting question. How far does the study of hymns
and hymn-books encourage the hope of a reunion of
hearts in the Church of God, rent, as it now is, by
many unhappy divisions?</p>
<p>In an Appendix I give a list of nearly a hundred and
<span class="pb" id="Page_330">330</span>
sixty hymns, which are found in the four representative
Non-episcopal hymnals and in one or both of two
representative Anglican books. These hymns are the
foundation material of what may be called the hymn-book
of the modern Church. Canon Ellerton said, &lsquo;The
study of Nonconformist hymn-books does not encourage
me in any hopes of what is sometimes called Home
Reunion.&rsquo; My own study of modern hymn-books leads
to an opposite conclusion. It is a commonplace of
hymnology that in all good hymn-books you find contributions
from men of widely different theological
schools. But it is not in the fact that the choir of the
Church includes Watts, Wesley, Heber, Montgomery,
Newman, Keble, Lyte, Charlotte Elliott, Mrs. Alexander,
Faber, S. J. Stone, Caswall, Bonar, Rawson, Neale, and
others, that I see the most hopeful sign. A still more
notable and instructive sign of the times is that alike
in the most familiar and in the most solemn moments
of life we draw nigh to God with the same words. Our
morning and our evening hymns, our Christmas carols
and our Easter anthems, are one. In the time of utmost
need we turn to the Saviour with the same cry&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Just as I am, without one plea</p>
<p class="t0">But that Thy blood was shed for me,</p>
<p class="t0">And that Thou bidd&rsquo;st me come to Thee,</p>
<p class="t2">O Lamb of God, I come.</p>
</div>
<p>Our battle-songs, our penitential prayers, our
hymns of adoration, are the same. We even tell the
story of our conversion in the same words&mdash;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_331">331</div>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">I heard the voice of Jesus say,</p>
<p class="t">Come unto Me and rest.</p>
</div>
<p>We teach our children to sing the same songs in
school and in the family.</p>
<p>Even more impressive is the fact that in the Holy
Communion the same hymns are sung in the great
cathedral, where men kneel before the high altar, and in
the homely village chapel, where simple folk sit down at
the Lord&rsquo;s Table. Charles Wesley the poet of Methodism,
Doddridge the Nonconformist pastor, Montgomery the
Moravian bookseller, Rawson the Congregational lawyer,
Bonar the Scotch Presbyterian, Bickersteth the Anglican
bishop, are the writers whose hymns are common to all
Englishmen as they break the bread and drink the
wine in memory of their Redeemer&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>We know no distinction of creed or Church when
we sing&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Come, let us join our friends above,</p>
<p class="t">That have obtained the prize;</p>
</div>
<p>and we are all one as we entrust our dead to the
Lord of Life&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Father, in Thy gracious keeping,</p>
<p class="t0">Leave we now Thy servant sleeping.</p>
</div>
<p>And when, wearied of earth and longing to depart and
be with Christ, we lift our eyes to the eternal city,
our Father&rsquo;s house on high, the hymns of St. Bernard
of Cluny or of Samuel Crossman are on the lips of
all&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">O happy place, when shall I be,</p>
<p class="t0">My God, with Thee to see Thy face?</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_332">332</div>
<p>There are many times when, amid the strife of
tongues, we feel that reunion is a dream never to be
fulfilled; but already we have found common ground in
lowly ministries to the poor and the distressed. And
they who are labourers together in the humblest and
divinest tasks, also join in the songs which, even on
earth, none but the redeemed can sing. In the service
of love, in the prayer of penitence, and in the sacrifice
of praise, we are already one in Christ Jesus.</p>
<p>Our goal, too, is the same, our diverse ways converge
as we draw nearer to God and Heaven. &lsquo;Many
ways have one end.&rsquo;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t">Jerusalem, where song nor gem</p>
<p class="t2">Nor fruit nor waters cease,</p>
<p class="t">God bring us to Jerusalem,</p>
<p class="t2">God bring us home in peace;</p>
<p class="t0">The strong who stand, the weak who fall,</p>
<p class="t0">The first and last, the great and small,</p>
<p class="t0">Home one by one, home one and all!</p>

for the influence he might have had. For he translated the Psalms
into French verse, put them to tunes, and set the Court singing them.
Let us think for a moment what England owes to those sweet and
simple hymns which it is our godly fashion to sing in the churches
and in the homes from earliest childhood, and which form a link to
connect our religion with our daily life. Let us only try to think
what we should be without these. And then give praise to Marot, for
it was he who gave to France what should have been the foundation
and beginning of a national book of praise and service of song, had
not the bigots, the stupid mischievous bigots, stopped the singing
because they pretended to see heresy in the words&mdash;David&rsquo;s words.

descended to the Howard family, and became the Duke&rsquo;s place; he
lost his head; passing to his eldest son, he sold it in 1592 to the
mayor, corporation, and citizens of London.&rsquo; The writer adds,
na&iuml;vely, &lsquo;This is a singular piece of history&rsquo; (p. 55).

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
